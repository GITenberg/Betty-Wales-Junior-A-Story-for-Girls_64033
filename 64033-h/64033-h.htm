<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls</span> who have not followed the adventures
of Betty Wales and her friends during
their freshman and sophomore years at Harding
College may enjoy a bit of an introduction
to the circle, before beginning the story of
their doings as juniors. Jolly, happy-go-lucky
Katherine Kittredge; Rachel Morrison,
as steady and dependable as Katherine was
volatile; shy, sensitive Roberta Lewis; Eleanor
Watson, beautiful, but not a general favorite;
forlorn little Helen Adams, and Betty Wales
were freshmen together at Mrs. Chapin&rsquo;s.
Mary Brooks, the only sophomore in the
house, did her best to make life a burden to
them in the amusing but innocent fashion that
hazing takes at Harding. The good times they
all had together and Betty&rsquo;s trials with Helen
Adams, who fell to her lot as roommate, and
with Eleanor Watson, whom she admired for
her cleverness and over whom she managed to
exert a strong influence for good, are recounted
in &ldquo;Betty Wales, Freshman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they were sophomores most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Chapin House girls moved to the campus,
where they were distributed among the various
college dwelling-houses, there to find new
interests and make new friends. Chief among
the latter was Madeline Ayres, the girl from
&ldquo;Bohemia, New York,&rdquo; whose original and
always artistic ideas for everything from political
parades and vaudeville shows to the
arrangement of a room and the soothing of
an irate editor won her vast popularity. Another
important addition was Dora Carlson&mdash;Eleanor
Watson&rsquo;s freshman she was called,
from her dog-like devotion to Eleanor. Dora
and Betty between them, with some help from
Madeline and some from Miss Ferris, a friend
on the college faculty, kept Eleanor from
utterly ruining her career at Harding. A
story not her own that she printed in the college
magazine made no end of trouble for
Eleanor and her friends, but in spite of that
the sophomore year was a merry one. Indeed
I think that Betty Wales and her set entered
upon their junior year with the firm conviction
that you couldn&rsquo;t help having a good
time at Harding&mdash;even if you tried.</p>

<small><small>THE FUN OF JUNIOR YEAR</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Hello</span>, Betty Wales. Please amuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty was sitting on the floor of her own
long-coveted &ldquo;single,&rdquo; surrounded by a bewildering
array of her possessions, which she
had unpacked according to her own particular
system of taking everything out at once, and
now, as usual, she had no idea where to dispose
of them. At the sound of the voice, the
unwonted pucker of anxiety left her forehead,
and she jumped up, scattering the photographs
she had been sorting right and left, and made
a rush for the newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary Brooks! Maybe I&rsquo;m not glad
to see you. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I think I&rsquo;m homesick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary grinned cheerfully. &ldquo;You ought to
be used to it by this time&mdash;to the joys of being
back on time, I mean. It&rsquo;s I that have reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>for feeling like a little lost lamb. Do you
know, this is positively my first appearance at
the regular opening functions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; laughed Betty. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going
to happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing new, I hope,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;but
Miss Stuart delicately hinted that the wrath
of Jove would descend upon me if I didn&rsquo;t get
here on time. Where&rsquo;s everybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty sadly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you come on the eight-fifteen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; returned Mary with decision.
&ldquo;Ever since I entered college I have heard
about the joyousness of coming up on the
eight-fifteen on an opening night. And now
I get here on time for once, and the New
York and the western trains are all fiendishly
late. So I come up alone in my glory on
that famous eight-fifteen, and instead of a
gay and festive occasion such as I have been
led to expect, I find an empty house&mdash;not a
soul but you to talk to, and positively nothing
doing. They seem to be all new girls on
my corridor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to refer to freshmen
as an empty house,&rdquo; said Betty severely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&ldquo;and anyhow it serves you right for all the
times you have cut over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you come?&rdquo; asked Mary, apparently
considering that one topic had been
pursued far enough. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t done all
this&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated the miscellaneous results
of Betty&rsquo;s unpacking by a sweeping
gesture&mdash;&ldquo;in just this one evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather not,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Mary, I&rsquo;ve
been here two whole days&mdash;not in the Belden
of course, because it wasn&rsquo;t open, but in Harding;
and I think that if you hadn&rsquo;t come
just when you did, I should have&mdash;cried,&rdquo;
ended Betty, in a sudden burst of confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor thing!&rdquo; said Mary sympathetically.
&ldquo;I suppose it was a freshman cousin or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty nodded. &ldquo;Lucile Merrifield. She&rsquo;s
a dear, and she said she didn&rsquo;t need me one
bit, but her mother and my mother settled it
that I was to come. And of course Lucile was
busy with her exams. and I didn&rsquo;t have anything
to do all day but sit around and think
what a lovely summer I&rsquo;d been having. And
that horrid woman we stayed with thought I
was the freshman and asked me right before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>a whole tableful of them if I was homesick&mdash;just
because Lucile happens to be tall and dignified,
and her hair is straight.&rdquo; Betty gave
a vicious pull to the yellow curl that would
escape from its companions and fall over her
eyes.</p>

<p>Mary grinned sympathetically. &ldquo;Too bad
about your childish ringlets,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ll bet your cousin isn&rsquo;t a circumstance to
mine&mdash;the eighth one from Wisconsin that
came on for her examinations last June. Was
yours the weeping kind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weeping!&rdquo; repeated Betty, laughing at the
idea of the stately Lucile dissolved in tears.
&ldquo;Not much. She was so calm and cool that
I thought she must have flunked and was
trying to cover it up. She had five examinations,
Mary, and they might have been five
afternoon teas for all she seemed to care; and
she isn&rsquo;t a dig or a prod, or anything of that
kind, either. So I got worried and made her
go all over the questions with me. As far as
I could see, she did awfully well. Anyhow I
don&rsquo;t believe she can possibly have flunked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a good idea!&rdquo; said Mary admiringly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t take a serious enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>view of my responsibilities last spring. But
then the eighth cousin was perfectly hopeless
and it was a mercy to everybody concerned
that she failed. She was the kind of person
that would rather risk making a bad break
than leave anything out. In her English
exam. they asked her what a leviathan was,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
mentioned in &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo; you know,&mdash;and
she said &lsquo;a country near Thrace.&rsquo; I
think myself that was her finish. It doesn&rsquo;t
do to be so positive unless you know you&rsquo;re in
the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s ever best to be positive,&rdquo;
said Betty sadly. &ldquo;I was so positive that I
wanted a single room, and now I&rsquo;ve got one,
and I&rsquo;m missing Helen Chase Adams already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll like it when you&rsquo;re settled,&rdquo;
Mary reassured her, glancing around the room.
&ldquo;Why do you have all the chiffonier drawers
open at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They stick,&rdquo; explained Betty savagely,
&ldquo;every blessed one of them. I&rsquo;ve got them
all open now except the bottom one, but it
took me almost an hour, and I&rsquo;m not going to
risk having to do it all over again. And a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>lmost
every one of the hooks in the closet is
broken, so I can&rsquo;t hang up my dresses; and look
at the spots on that wall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary squinted near-sightedly at the black
stains. &ldquo;Jane Drew must have had a quarrel
with one of her pictures and thrown an ink
bottle at it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder how she
covered up the tragedy. I never noticed those
spots last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have had a very big picture,&rdquo;
said Betty. &ldquo;My biggest Gibson girl won&rsquo;t do
it. And my desk won&rsquo;t go into that corner
where Jane had hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number twenty-seven must have shrunk
during the summer,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I hope my
palatial apartment hasn&rsquo;t lost any of its six
by ten spaciousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; began
Betty at last, &ldquo;are you tired or are you
blue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; declared Mary savagely, &ldquo;blue as a
heron. (Did we ever find one in the Mary-Bird-Club,
Betty?) I wondered if you&rsquo;d notice
it. I hate being a senior. I know it&rsquo;s going
to be perfectly deadly&mdash;this seeing the last of
things. How do you like being a junior?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty hesitated. &ldquo;Mary, does it always
last,&mdash;the fun of college? Did you ever know
a girl who&rsquo;d been very, very fond of it for two
years to get tired of it all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Mary decidedly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just what the girls I used to know at home are
always asking me. &lsquo;Why do you stay on so
long, Mary? Don&rsquo;t you get bored?&rsquo; And
when I try to explain, I suppose they think
it all sounds very dull. I presume I should
think so myself, if I hadn&rsquo;t been here to see.
One year is a good deal like the ones before it,&mdash;the
same friends, only a few more each year,
the same nice little stunts, and almost the same
things to try for,&mdash;but somehow each one is
different and there&rsquo;s plenty of excitement all
along the road. If you&rsquo;re afraid of outgrowing
it, as you would a prep. school, you
needn&rsquo;t be. College is too big to be outgrown.
It has a new side ready for any new side that
you can develop. I say, Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; inquired Betty absently. She was
wondering how Mary had guessed that she
had developed some new sides during the long
vacation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you&rsquo;d like to know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>since you&rsquo;re so fond of Eleanor Watson.
More or less about that affair of hers last year
has leaked out during the summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean about the story she signed her
name to in the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; and didn&rsquo;t exactly
write. I don&rsquo;t know the details, except that
you were mixed up in it somehow; but I think
she did the very square thing when she
resigned from Dramatic Club, and I mean to
stand by her, and so does Laurie. Eleanor
was on the train to-night, and some of the
girls rather turned the cold shoulder. I
thought&mdash;you might like to know right away
how matters stood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Betty soberly, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll need me much now, Mary.
I think she&rsquo;s learned how to help herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky,&rdquo; said Mary easily. &ldquo;Now
Roberta Lewis doesn&rsquo;t seem to get one bit
more independent. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s never
going to be very happy here. She ought to
go in hard for writing; I know she&rsquo;d make a
success of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her so,&rdquo; advised Betty. &ldquo;She adores
you, and now that you&rsquo;re on the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; staff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>you certainly ought to be able to influence
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought,&rdquo; conceded Mary. &ldquo;The
trouble is I&rsquo;ve never really seen much that she
wrote except those valentine verses that she
did for us in her freshman year, and she says
those were mostly French translations. So
when I tell her that I know she can write, she
says I&rsquo;m prejudiced and haven&rsquo;t any good
reason for thinking so. She hasn&rsquo;t one bit of
self-confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a thump and then a thud in the
hall. A door banged, somebody shrieked,
&ldquo;Oh, Polly, you darling child!&rdquo; and then
Katherine Kittredge burst into Betty&rsquo;s room
like a whirlwind, dragging Roberta Lewis
after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just this minute in,&rdquo; she panted,
&ldquo;on a special that they sent up from the junction,
because they couldn&rsquo;t bear to have us sitting
around the waiting-room down there
breaking the ten o&rsquo;clock rule. Roberta fairly
insisted that I should come here first. How&rsquo;s
everything starting off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I insisted!&rdquo; repeated Roberta indignantly.
&ldquo;K. was in such a hurry to get here that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>wouldn&rsquo;t wait for a car, and there wasn&rsquo;t any
carriage, and my suit case weighs a ton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I carried it,&rdquo; retorted Katherine,
fanning herself with the biggest Gibson girl.
&ldquo;And Mary, you should have seen the elegant
Roberta, lugging my handsome telescope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know that we&rsquo;d voted a class-tax
to buy you a sole-leather suit case lined with
white satin?&rdquo; inquired Mary Brooks. Katherine&rsquo;s
battered canvas bag was a college joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; returned Katherine
serenely. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rachel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; called a merry voice, and Rachel
herself appeared in the doorway and was
dragged in, amid great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you come, Rachel?&rdquo; asked
Betty, leading her to a seat of honor on the
window-box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At four,&rdquo; said Rachel, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been tutoring
conditioned freshmen ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor thing!&rdquo; sighed Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; laughed Rachel. &ldquo;My pocketbook
is fairly bursting. Besides, they were
dears, all of them. One took me to supper at
Holmes&rsquo;s, so she could get more time for her
math., and we talked cube root and binomial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>theorem over the most delicious chicken
salad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rachel was still economizing at the little
white house around the corner, but she was
too happy at finding herself back in Harding
again to feel one bit of envy for the campus
girls, who never had to worry over finances,
or plan how to make both ends meet.</p>

<p>The four were still all talking at once when
Madeline Ayres appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No room for under-class men,&rdquo; shouted
Mary, brandishing a pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toss it over, please,&rdquo; said Madeline, complacently,
holding out one arm for the pillow
and hugging Betty with the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit
on it here by the door and keep them out.
This is where the French I passed up last fall
begins to count. I&rsquo;m a junior now, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried Katherine. &ldquo;Good
for 19&mdash;! You always belonged to us in
spirit, Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen Adams has come. Let&rsquo;s go call on
her,&rdquo; suggested Rachel, and they trooped off
down the hall.</p>

<p>Their progress was slow, for out of almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>every door excited damsels swooped down
upon them, wishing to shake hands all around
and to talk about everything, from where you
spent your summer to the new man who was
going to teach English &ldquo;Lit.,&rdquo; you know, and
his courses would be just splendid because&mdash;and
do you suppose we shall ever get our
trunks?</p>

<p>Betty met them all with an enthusiasm
which soon ceased to be feigned. The spirit
of the place was contagious. It caught her
up and swept her along until all her woes
were forgotten or turned into merry jests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you a real French poster to cover
those spots,&rdquo; Madeline promised her, &ldquo;and I
can put up closet-hooks. I took manual training
one summer, and I own a hammer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go down-town and buy the
hooks,&rdquo; suggested some one, &ldquo;and have ices
on the way back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait till to-morrow. Let&rsquo;s hunt up
Eleanor Watson first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the three B&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has any one seen Nita Reese?&rdquo;</p>

<p>How the evening flew! Nobody in 19&mdash; unpacked.
It was much better fun to wander in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>gay exploring parties from one campus house
to another, finding out who was back, and
who had changed rooms, and hearing all the
campus news. The reason why junior year is
the nicest speedily became evident to Betty and
her friends of 19&mdash;. By that time you know
everybody and have found your place in the
college world; but you are not yet weighed
down by the responsibilities of seniority, nor
oppressed by the nearness of the end.</p>

<p>When Betty returned to her disheveled
apartment at ten o&rsquo;clock, she found her Cousin
Lucile sitting on the window-box in the dark,
awaiting her arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear little freshman,&rdquo; she began in the
most patronizing tone she could manage,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s high time you were safe
in bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucile calmly, &ldquo;but I had to
consult you, Betty. I have a chance to get
into this house. A Miss Reeve or Reed or
something telegraphed the registrar that she
was going to the Philippines to be married,
and I can have her place. It&rsquo;s a double room,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not T. Reed?&rdquo; cried Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think her name was Theresa. Is her
room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty dashed into the hall. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she
cried to the avenue of open doors, &ldquo;T. Reed&rsquo;s
going to be married to a Filipino&mdash;well, anyhow,
in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she returned to Lucile, leaving her
bomb to take effect as it might. &ldquo;It will be
lovely to have you in the house,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and the campus is certainly the place to be.
I wonder if Helen knows that T.&rsquo;s not coming.
If so, she must have had a telegram since I
saw her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Betty,&rdquo; began Lucile doubtfully, &ldquo;I
want to find out about Miss Reed&rsquo;s room and
her roommate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; broke in Betty. &ldquo;I
had them last year. The closet is awfully
small, but next year perhaps you can have a
single.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Betty,&rdquo; persisted Lucile, &ldquo;this is a
serious matter to me. Are you sure I shall
like her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see,&rdquo; laughed Betty, starting for
the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten now and you&rsquo;ll be locked
in, but as long as you&rsquo;re here you may as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>stay with me to-night and see how we live on
the campus. But then,&rdquo; she turned back to
add, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so important, Lucile,&mdash;your
liking her or not. You can&rsquo;t help liking college,
roommate or no roommate, closet-hooks
or no closet-hooks. (I haven&rsquo;t any of those
yet. That&rsquo;s why my room is in such a mess,&mdash;or
at least it&rsquo;s one reason.)&rdquo; She gave a
long sigh of content. &ldquo;Oh, Lucile, this is the
grandest place, especially if you live up here
on the campus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Brooks came through the hall just in
time to catch Betty&rsquo;s last sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Betty Wales,&rdquo; she said severely,
&ldquo;what do you mean by talking like that?
You told me not two hours ago that you were
horribly bored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty laughed. &ldquo;So I was,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;two
hours ago. I was sure that all the fun was
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the moral of that,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;is:
Don&rsquo;t judge of the ball until it has opened.
Introduce me to your cousin, please, and then
both of you are elected to come and help me
eat five pounds of caramels.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<small><small>THE CLUB OF MERRY HEARTS</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were all in number 27 Belden, which,
in spite of its small size, or perhaps because its
small size made it seem particularly cozy, was
their favorite rendezvous during junior year.
&ldquo;They&rdquo; means the &ldquo;clan,&rdquo; which had been
developed from the &ldquo;old guard&rdquo; of freshman
year by a few subtractions and several important
additions. The three B&rsquo;s belonged,
of course, and Madeline Ayres and Nita Reese.
Mary Brooks was the privileged senior member.
Rachel met with the clan when she
could, but her conditioned freshmen took up
most of her spare time, and in her few leisure
moments what she liked best was a quiet talk
with Betty, or a brisk tramp through the
woods with Katherine or Roberta. Eleanor
Watson had never really fitted in with the
rest of Betty&rsquo;s friends, and now she was more
of an outsider than ever. The story of her
sophomore year had been circulated widely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>among the influential girls at Harding. Only
the bare facts had leaked out, and there was
no proof of them; but Eleanor&rsquo;s previous
career at Harding made it much easier to believe
than to discredit such a story. Very few
of the girls felt, as Mary Brooks did, that the
resignation from Dramatic Club entitled Eleanor
to any special consideration; and since
young people are almost invariably cruel when
they mean only to be just, Eleanor had had
to brave both open scorn and veiled hostility.
But she did not flinch. She was almost
pathetically grateful to Mary and Marion
Lawrence, to Miss Ferris, and to Rachel and
Katherine, but she would not let Betty force
her upon the rest of the clan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to see you when you&rsquo;re alone,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but you must wait till I&rsquo;ve proved
to the others that I&rsquo;m different. Of course
they don&rsquo;t trust me or like me now. How
could they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Betty waited, sure that in the end Eleanor
would win back the confidence that she
had forfeited, and gain besides respect and
love for the stronger, sweeter nature that she
was developing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>It is odd how positions shift. Eleanor Watson
had spoiled all the chances that had
seemed so brilliant at the beginning of her
college course, and Helen Adams, shy, awkward,
unfriended little freshman, had become
that envied and enviable personage, a &ldquo;prominent
girl.&rdquo; Betty had helped, and Madeline
and Miss Mills, but Lucile, without trying to,
had done more than any of them. She regarded
her roommate in the light of a strange
phenomenon, both amazing and amusing and
absolutely unique in her experience of girls;
and she spread this view of Helen widely
among her freshman friends. And Helen
blossomed out. She saw that at last the girls
really liked her for herself, and enjoyed her
quaint little fancies and original ideas about
persons and places. And so, as Mary Brooks
put it, she let herself go; she forgot to be
sensitive and frightened and ill at ease, and
before she knew it all her dreams were coming
true. She was somebody &ldquo;at last&rdquo;; the
class of 19&mdash; and the clan both wanted her
and were proud of her.</p>

<p>So she was in &ldquo;twenty-seven&rdquo; that night,
and Katherine, of course, and Roberta, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>was hardly sociable enough to be on the footing
of regular membership in the clan, but
who followed Mary to its gatherings as she
would have followed her through fire and
water if Mary had been bound that way.</p>

<p>Madeline Ayres was doing a French song,
in a costume that she had improvised for the
occasion out of a black silk scarf, a bunch of
pink roses, and a peacock-feather fan. The
song was so very slangy that no one but
Madeline had much idea what it meant; but
the rhythm and Madeline&rsquo;s pantomime were
delicious, and though she sang all the verses
and composed several new impromptu ones,
her audience still clamored for more. When
she finally declared that she had &ldquo;positively
finished&rdquo; and they might as well stop teasing
first as last, Babbie arose gravely and gave an
imitation of a nervous little girl speaking
&ldquo;Mary had a little lamb.&rdquo; Babbie had never
done a &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; before, and the delight of her
friends in this new accomplishment was unbounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s have the rabbit,&rdquo; said Mary
Brooks, when the applause had died away.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late and we don&rsquo;t want to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>too hurried. We can have more stunts later
if there&rsquo;s any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rabbit!&rdquo; repeated Betty in mystified
tones. &ldquo;Whoever said anything about a
rabbit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; confessed Katherine bravely.
&ldquo;That is, I told Mary that we didn&rsquo;t have
a thing fit to eat for supper at the Westcott,
and that I thought perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Betty, laughing, &ldquo;but it
can&rsquo;t be a rabbit, because I haven&rsquo;t any cheese.
Will tea do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s got cheese,&rdquo; announced Babe. &ldquo;Last
time we had a rabbit party we forgot about
cheese till we had lighted the chafing-dish.
So we sent Bob for it, and she bought five
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bob defended herself, &ldquo;there were
piles of people there, and I knew that five
quarts of ice cream isn&rsquo;t any too much for a
spread, so I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry now, Bob,&rdquo; ordered Mary, selecting
an ulster from the pile in the corner, and
hustling the rebellious Bob into it and out
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s rather hard on Bob to have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>help me give a party, just because K. happens
to be hungry,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ravenous too,&rdquo; announced Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Madeline, &ldquo;and so are
we all. Have you plenty of crackers, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Betty, tugging at the
lowest drawer of the chiffonier. &ldquo;I keep
them in here because it shuts so tight that
the mice don&rsquo;t smell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And other thieves cannot break through
and borrow,&rdquo; murmured Katherine, applying
her basket-ball arm to the refractory drawer.</p>

<p>Bob presently returned with the cheese, and
the rabbit was well under way, when Nita
Reese spied a new pin on Helen&rsquo;s stock.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Helen?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philosophical Club,&rdquo; announced Helen
proudly. &ldquo;I was taken in last Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Brooks reached over Roberta&rsquo;s shoulder
and unceremoniously helped herself to the
pin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully pretty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What
does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen explained, and the pin, which was
the emblem of a new and very learned Harding
society, went around the circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed Babe, when it reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>her, &ldquo;I wish I could be a prod. in something!
I shall never go into Dramatic Club or Clio,
because Babbie&rsquo;s in one and Bob&rsquo;s in the
other, and they think two of us is enough to
take. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly get into any of the
learned societies, like this one, and I&rsquo;m not
musical, so I can&rsquo;t belong to the Glee or Banjo
Clubs. I&rsquo;ve lost my class-pin, and I shan&rsquo;t
have another till I&rsquo;m an &lsquo;alum.&rsquo; Besides
everybody can wear the alumnæ pin, so who
cares for that?&rdquo; Babe&rsquo;s long plaint ended in
a dolorous sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Babe!&rdquo; laughed Betty. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you B&rsquo;s have a pin of your own? Three B&rsquo;s
would make a lovely monogram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babe shook her head. &ldquo;No, because when
I came back to visit after I&rsquo;m out nobody
would know what it meant. I want to belong
to something that will keep on always, and
amount to something.&rdquo; Babe tumbled back
on the couch with a vehemence that upset the
alcohol bottle, and sent its contents streaming
over Betty&rsquo;s desk.</p>

<p>When the dripping papers had been laid out
to dry and order was once more restored, the
silent Roberta electrified the assembly by mak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ing
a suggestion. &ldquo;I think it would be lots
of fun for those of us who are here to organize
a society. We could have a pin, and when we
leave we could pass the society down to a
crowd in one of the lower classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; cried Babe wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you mustn&rsquo;t count me in,&rdquo; said Mary
Brooks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent all my November allowance
already, and besides, I hate pins. The
pretty ones get lost the first thing, and the
homely ones just lie around till they&rsquo;re too
tarnished to wear. Anyway, I have six now,
or I should have if they weren&rsquo;t mostly lost&mdash;or
lent,&rdquo; concluded Mary, smiling absently as
she thought of the whereabouts of some of the
absentees.</p>

<p>Babe and Roberta looked crestfallen at
Mary&rsquo;s dash of cold water, and Betty hastened
to the rescue. &ldquo;I think it would be lovely to
have a society,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why not have it
fixed so that whoever wants the pin can have
it, and those who don&rsquo;t care for it or can&rsquo;t afford
it, like the penniless Miss Brooks, can belong
just the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might make the ones who don&rsquo;t wear
pins officers,&rdquo; suggested Madeline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy thought,&rdquo; agreed Mary. &ldquo;But
then, of course, you&rsquo;d want me for president
anyway, because I&rsquo;m the only senior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No reason at all,&rdquo; said Katherine, severely.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been holding the whip-hand over us
ever since we were freshmen. All the same I
move that the secretary be instructed to cast a
unanimous ballot for the penniless Miss
Brooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any secretary,&rdquo; objected
matter-of-fact Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeline can be secretary,&rdquo; suggested
Babbie, &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s had experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Madeline, complacently.
&ldquo;Only I won&rsquo;t write any reports, because nobody
ever wants to hear them and I object to
making a bore of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good point,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;Madame
President, I move that in the&mdash;what&rsquo;s going
to be the name of this organization, girls?
Well, anyhow, I move that the secretary be
instructed to write no reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think motions are just as much of a bore
as reports,&rdquo; declared Babbie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not have
any of those either.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how can we do any business?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shan&rsquo;t have any to do,&rdquo; suggested
Betty. &ldquo;But does anybody object to
names? Because it does seem as if we needed
a name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one objected to naming the organization,
and the president announced that she awaited
suggestions. The assembly was lost in deep
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Betty at last, &ldquo;that
the name you give a society depends a good
deal on what kind of society it is? Don&rsquo;t you
think we ought to decide on the object first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I detest objects,&rdquo; broke in Madeline,
hastily. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to have an
object I shall really have to resign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Madeline,&rdquo; protested Betty, &ldquo;we must
have that, you know. What&rsquo;s the use of a
club without one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gives me a chance to wear a pin,&rdquo; answered
Babe promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; ventured Roberta timidly,
&ldquo;that &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; would be a
good name for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid! Fine! Just the thing!&rdquo; chorused
everybody at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Betty Wales,&rdquo; shouted Madeline in
triumph, as soon as she could be heard above
the din, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see that an object isn&rsquo;t at
all necessary? &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; needn&rsquo;t
do a thing but enjoy themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, that&rsquo;s an object, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; retorted
Helen, rushing gallantly to Betty&rsquo;s defense.
&ldquo;Having a good time is an object just
as much as sending missionaries to China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; confessed Madeline, resignedly.
&ldquo;Anyhow, I can&rsquo;t hope to win an
argument against the prod. of the logic class
and a member of Philosophical, so I give
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything about Logic,&rdquo;
said Babe, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure that this is just the
name we want. Everybody knows that we
have the best time going. And when we go
we can pass the society on to the jolliest crowd
that&rsquo;s left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; began Katherine,
dubiously, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s rather silly for us to have
a society just for fun? We&rsquo;re called &lsquo;The
Clan&rsquo; now, you know. We see one another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>all the time, and we couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
more fun than we do as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it will be so much stuntier this
new way,&rdquo; demurred Bob.</p>

<p>Betty had been listening to the discussion
rather absently, wanting to make a suggestion
and wondering how the girls would receive
it. She had not forgotten her last evening
with Dorothy King, nor Dorothy&rsquo;s parting injunction.
&ldquo;See that everybody has a fair
chance and a good time,&rdquo; Dorothy had said,
and Betty had been trying to do it. But
Harding was a big college, and there were so
many other things to attend to. If only the
clan would help! Katherine&rsquo;s speech gave
her her opportunity, and she seized it eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it
would be nice for &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; to try
to make other people have a good time too?
As K. says, we have as much fun as we possibly
can now; and so many girls don&rsquo;t have
any. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be nice to
try to make more &lsquo;Merry Hearts&rsquo; in Harding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the clan looked doubtful, and
Babe&rsquo;s smooth forehead was puckered into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>frown of disapproval. &ldquo;Anybody can have a
good time here if they try,&rdquo; she asserted ungrammatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Helen quickly.
&ldquo;Some of them don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they ought to learn,&rdquo; declared
Madeline. &ldquo;In Bohemian New York, everybody
has good times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Madeline,&rdquo; broke in Nita Reese solemnly,
&ldquo;I know a sophomore who&rsquo;s never
been to a house dance or play or to an open
meeting of one of the societies. What do you
think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d better ask her to
the next Belden House play,&rdquo; laughed Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; Madeline took her up, &ldquo;she
may be just as happy as you are, Nita. A
person isn&rsquo;t really and truly happy until she&rsquo;s
learned that it&rsquo;s not what you have, or what
you do, that counts, nor even your friends, but
just yourself; and you can make of yourself
just about what you choose to. That&rsquo;s the
spirit of Bohemia, and if Betty wants &lsquo;The
Merry Hearts&rsquo; to encourage it here, why, I&rsquo;m
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; called Mary Brooks, rapping for
order with the chafing-dish spoon, &ldquo;I foresee
that this discussion isn&rsquo;t coming out anywhere,
and besides, the rules of the society
prevent our putting the question to vote. So
I shall settle it in accordance with the policy
of &lsquo;The Merry Hearts.&rsquo; Whoever likes Betty&rsquo;s
idea can act upon it. The rest needn&rsquo;t. Only
I want to say this,&rdquo; went on Mary quickly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out lately that you can have
plenty of fun when you&rsquo;re doing things for
other people. I never used to think so, but
there was the Student&rsquo;s Aid Fair last year, for
instance. I never had more fun out of anything,
and yet it helped a lot of girls to stay in
college. I think it would be fine for &lsquo;The
Merry Hearts&rsquo; to get up something like that
this year, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital! Great! The very thing!&rdquo;
chorused &ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right in our line,&rdquo; conceded
Babe. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t think Betty meant having
fairs and things. I thought she meant
being nice to freaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did mean something more like that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Babe,&rdquo; Betty explained. &ldquo;But I think Mary&rsquo;s
idea is lovely too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why can&rsquo;t we do both?&rdquo; asked
Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We certainly can,&rdquo; declared Mary. &ldquo;One
comes under the wording of the name just as
much as the other, though I fancy that Betty&rsquo;s
idea is more useful. The anti-snob spirit is
certainly needed in this college, and I hope
&lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; will show a lot of it. Now
I appoint Babe and Roberta pin committee,
and Madeline special lecturer on the Bohemian
spirit. You can write it up for the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;
too, Madeline. I&rsquo;m always wanting essays for
my department. And now I&rsquo;m happy to say
that the next business of this meeting is to eat
up the rabbit.&rdquo;</p>

<small><small>THE BEGINNING OF GEORGIA AMES</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a breathless Indian summer day.
Every window in number ten Main Building
was open, but there was never a breeze to stir
the heavy air or break the spell of delicious
languor that hung over the class in &ldquo;English
Essayists of the Nineteenth Century.&rdquo; The
new associate professor in English had the
course. His name was John Elliot Eaton,
after which he could write several mystic
combinations of letters, indicating his high
rank in the world of scholarship. He was
lecturing this hot morning in his rapid, jerky
fashion that made note-taking almost an impossibility.
He did not seem to mind the
weather in the least; if anything he talked
faster and more eloquently than usual. Presently
he came to a sudden halt, and glancing
ominously at the clock made a dreaded announcement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will write, please, for the remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ten minutes, on the topic previously assigned.
I will finish what I had to say at the next recitation.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The class in English Essayists drew a deep
sigh and set to work.</p>

<p>Dr. John Elliot Eaton was as brilliant as
reports had foretold when the term opened.
He was also young and handsome, and he had
charming manners, though he seldom let his
classes know it. Generally he sat before them
as cold, relentless, and impersonal as an icicle;
and the minute the gong sounded the close of
the hour he became, if possible, colder and
more impenetrable than before. Even Babbie
Hildreth, who was supposed to be going
through college &ldquo;on her smile,&rdquo; found it impossible
to &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; Dr. Eaton. Why he chose
to be so unbending, no one knew. One party
declared that he was afraid of girls, and trying
to hide it; another said that he was a woman-hater,
and didn&rsquo;t intend to be bored by the
attentions of susceptible damsels. Why, in
the latter case, he was teaching at Harding,
was not evident. His riding horse, his clothes,
and his air of athletic, care-free well-being indicated
that he was not dependent on an as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sociate
professor&rsquo;s salary. Altogether he furnished
an interesting subject for research.
But there was one drawback; it was impossible
to know him at all outside of his classes,
and there he was devoted to ten-minute tests.
His pupils hoped that he would speedily outgrow
this taste,&mdash;it was quite evident that he
was doing his first teaching. Meanwhile they
endured stoically, and loftily informed their
jeering friends, who had not elected English
Essayists, that the really interesting courses
were never &ldquo;snaps&rdquo;; and besides there was
one fine thing about Dr. Eaton. He almost
never called the roll, and he was a perfect
gentleman about cuts.</p>

<p>Madeline Ayres lounged comfortably on the
back row and watched her companions struggling
to express their opinions on &ldquo;the topic
previously assigned.&rdquo; It happened to be the
characteristics of Matthew Arnold. Madeline
had exhausted the subject in five illegible
lines, written in half as many minutes. She
folded and signed her paper, and leaned forward
to see how the girls on the row in front
of her were progressing. Babe was chewing
her pencil busily. Helen Adams was on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>second page and&mdash;yes, she had actually divided
her work into paragraphs! Madeline shrugged
her shoulders, in token of her scorn for such
foolishness, and looked at the clock. Then
she glanced at the platform where Dr. Eaton
sat, wearing his cold, slightly bored expression,
and not showing the slightest interest in
the spectacle before him.</p>

<p>Madeline Ayres differed from the majority
in finding Dr. Eaton dull. His blasé air irritated,
instead of interesting her, and she
longed to startle him out of it, in spite of himself.
Now she would try to do it. Lazily she
reached out a long arm for the sheet of paper
which Helen Adams had been hoarding against
a possible emergency, and meeting Helen&rsquo;s
glance of protest with a pathetically beseeching
gesture, she went to work again, as if her
life depended upon filling that sheet before
the gong struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have forgotten the exact wording of the
topic,&rdquo; wrote Madeline slowly, in a painstaking
backhand that she resorted to in times of
stress, &ldquo;but &lsquo;Matthew Arnold and the Ten-Minute
Test&rsquo; occurs to me as an interesting
point of departure. How would Matthew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Arnold view a ten-minute exposition of his
characteristic qualities by a class of young
ladies (most of them deep-dyed Philistines)?
I fancy he would say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline had made her point and turned
several neat sentences before the &ldquo;remaining
ten minutes&rdquo; was exhausted. She folded her
second sheet as she had her first, paused an
instant before writing &ldquo;Georgia Ames&rdquo; on the
outside, and giving both the papers to Babe to
hand in, went out by the back door. Half
an hour later she had forgotten all about Dr.
Eaton in a heated pursuit of grasshoppers on
the back campus. Biology was Madeline&rsquo;s
newest hobby.</p>

<p>She was late for English Essayists the next
morning. The class had been called to order
and Professor Eaton was beginning to read
something to them. Madeline dropped into a
seat near the door, found the place in her
note-book, and shook her fountain-pen into
working-order, before she realized that he was
reading Georgia Ames&rsquo;s remarks upon &ldquo;Matthew
Arnold and the Ten-Minute Test,&rdquo; with
evident liking for Georgia&rsquo;s ideas. Some of
the class got the point of the theme, and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>did not. Madeline smiled inanely for the
benefit of her neighbors, and wondered if the
professor would try to pick out Georgia Ames.
Apparently he had not even noticed the signature;
for when he came to the end of the
theme, he looked at it curiously, consulted his
roll, and added the new name at the end of
the list. Then, with a scathing comment upon
the deadly commonplaceness of the other
themes, he opened his portfolio and continued
his unfinished lecture.</p>

<p>Madeline took notes in a leisurely fashion
and wondered if it was her duty to go up at
the end of the hour and claim Georgia
Ames&rsquo;s contribution. She had already accomplished
her object, by striking a spark of
enthusiasm out of the blasé Dr. Eaton; but
she decided that it would be just as well to
wait a little before giving her explanation.
Georgia Ames might prove a valuable ally in
some other time of need. Madeline lost the
thread of the lecture as she considered the vast
possibilities of a second self.</p>

<p>She brought the subject up at luncheon,
without mentioning Georgia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could do the things you never have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>time to,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and the things you
hate, or can&rsquo;t do well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care to be your second self,&rdquo;
said Mary Brooks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a perfect
drudge of her,&mdash;keep her mending stockings
and doing errands all her days. You might
as well hire a maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point,&rdquo; admitted Madeline;
&ldquo;but I should take care not to abuse her.
She would be a very fascinating person, I assure
you. You see, not really being anybody
she could do just as she pleased, without caring
what people thought of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; exclaimed Roberta. &ldquo;Then
she could say all the things you want to but
don&rsquo;t dare, and believe all the things that you
want to, only you are afraid people will think
you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that if Madeline&rsquo;s second self
would be a drudge, yours would be a freak,
Roberta,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered Roberta, &ldquo;she would
just be delightfully clever and original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Betty, who, not being at all
imaginative, had listened to the discussion in
wondering silence, &ldquo;for my part I&rsquo;m sure one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>self is as much as I want to manage. Think
of planning a Saturday afternoon for two people,
or making out two schedules of studies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of all that,&rdquo; said Madeline,
passing her plate for more dessert, &ldquo;but I
should have my second self vanish when she
wasn&rsquo;t needed, or when things were getting too
complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently second selves are going to be
Madeline&rsquo;s next fad,&rdquo; said Mary with a sigh of
tolerance. &ldquo;Prepare to see her catching grasshoppers
with a ghostly double beside her.&rdquo;
She turned to Madeline. &ldquo;You do get the
funniest notions. What put this idea into
your head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it just blew in,&rdquo; said Madeline lazily.
&ldquo;Then it sprouted, and now I&rsquo;m very curious
to see how tall it will grow.&rdquo; With which
lucid explanation she sauntered off to the
library.</p>

<p>She was really getting very much interested
in Georgia Ames, but, as she was also very
much interested in a number of other things,
and as Georgia obviously would keep until she
was wanted, Madeline was in no haste to push
her forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>That day&rsquo;s recitation in English Essayists
had been the last of the week, and it was the
third recitation of the following week before
the class had any more written work. Madeline
finished hers with her usual promptness,
and then, having nothing else to do, wrote a
paper for Georgia Ames, not because she had
anything particular to say, but on the principle
that Georgia, being on the professor&rsquo;s roll,
would better be doing her work.</p>

<p>That night the Belden House gave its annual
dance in the gym. It was still Indian
summer weather and the moon was full.
Madeline, who did not share the enthusiasm
of most Harding girls for man-less dances, arranged
her program with a view to frequent
intervals of moonlight and solitude on the
back campus. She danced the first number
with one of her guests, and then strolled
out to enjoy numbers two, three and four,
which were blanks. She found a belated
hammock, sole relic of the joys of springtime,
swinging under the yellowing apple-trees,
and lay back in it, listening to the
music that floated out, soft and sweet, from
the gaily lighted gym., and enjoying that de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>licious
sense of evaded responsibility which
only the true Bohemian, without even the
vestige of a New England conscience, can experience.</p>

<p>The orchestra had finished number two,
which was a martial two-step, and begun upon
three, a rippling, swinging waltz, when Madeline&rsquo;s
attention was attracted by the grotesque
antics of a girl who was sitting, or crouching,
on the edge of a circle of light cast by the
electric lamp in front of the Hilton House.
Madeline watched her strange gestures for a
moment, until something in the huddled
shape suggested Bob Parker, and assured that
all Bob&rsquo;s performances were interesting, Madeline
left her hammock and went over to investigate.
The shape proved to be Bob, but a
nearer view gave no more clue to her strange
behavior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; demanded Madeline, &ldquo;what in the
world are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob, who appeared to be absolutely engrossed
in her odd pursuit, looked up as
Madeline spoke and surveyed her calmly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite evident what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; she
said severely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re catching your death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>of cold in that low dress, and you&rsquo;re cutting
your own house dance. Did you hear Nita
Reese inquiring for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madeline, sweetly, &ldquo;but she
told me that she was pleased to death to have
one less guest to bother with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she never said that,&rdquo; retorted Bob,
quite unmoved. &ldquo;Nita&rsquo;s always so polite.
I hope she thought it though, but anyhow
I couldn&rsquo;t go. I went riding this afternoon
and the horse ran away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he spill you off on this spot, and have
you been here ever since?&rdquo; asked Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I been here ever since?&rdquo; repeated
Bob indignantly. &ldquo;He spilled me four miles
from here, my friend, and I walked home and
sent an exploring expedition after the horse,
and dressed, and had dinner down-town and
came here afterward. How&rsquo;s that for strenuousness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Madeline reverted to her original
inquiry&mdash;&ldquo;what are you doing now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Bob, cheerfully, &ldquo;you did
ask that. I&mdash;wait a minute, Madeline. There
he is again.&rdquo; Bob was off to the opposite end
of the lighted space. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>more &lsquo;Merry Hearts,&rsquo;&rdquo; she explained, returning
and sitting down again at Madeline&rsquo;s feet.
&ldquo;You know the Hilton House has a family of
tame toads that live under the front steps.
Well, I&rsquo;m teaching them not to hop across the
sidewalks, so they won&rsquo;t be accidentally
stepped on and come to untimely ends.
They&rsquo;re learning fast, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely thought,&rdquo; laughed Madeline.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you find any sad hearts around
here but toads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grasshoppers,&rdquo; said Bob, promptly, &ldquo;but
they&rsquo;re about gone now, poor things. Next
spring I&rsquo;m going to have a grasshopper class
in high jumping. It&rsquo;s a shame the way they
let you zoölogy fiends catch them for easy
victims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Madeline, admiringly, &ldquo;you
are certainly a genius. I was thinking to-day
that &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; needed a boom. We
haven&rsquo;t done anything so far except organize.&rdquo;
Madeline swirled suddenly into the darkness.
&ldquo;At the next meeting I believe I shall propose
a new member&mdash;just to liven things up a
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob shrugged her shoulders, frowning. &ldquo;If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>it&rsquo;s Eleanor Watson, I don&rsquo;t want her,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I know Betty does and Betty&rsquo;s a dear,
and what she says goes with the B&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;re
going to be nice to the freaks, but we don&rsquo;t
want Eleanor Watson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; laughed Madeline. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not Eleanor. It&rsquo;s quite a different person,
Bob,&mdash;quite one of your sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The music from the gym stopped suddenly,
and Madeline consulted her card. &ldquo;Let me
see&mdash;two, three, four. Yes, the next is five,
and I have it with an adoring freshman.
Good-bye, Bob,&mdash;and please don&rsquo;t black-ball
my new member.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quite</span> by accident Roberta Lewis was the
first person to whom Madeline confided the
story of Georgia Ames. Roberta happened to
pass through the hall just as Madeline came
back from getting some corrected English
themes, among them two of Georgia&rsquo;s, with
very flattering comments from Dr. Eaton; and
finding the story too good to keep, she called
Roberta in to share it. She could not have
chosen a more appreciative confidante.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard anything so nice,&rdquo; declared
Roberta, eagerly. &ldquo;How did you ever think
of doing it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline gave a characteristic shrug of
indifference. &ldquo;Oh, I just happened to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t any one else know about
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lovely secret to be in! Are you
ever going to tell Dr. Eaton?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may some time, or I may let it
run along until midyears. Of course he&rsquo;s
bound to find out then that there&rsquo;s no such
person, for he&rsquo;ll have to send his lists to the
registrar&rsquo;s office and there&rsquo;s no fooling Miss
Stuart. I thought it might be amusing to
keep quiet till then, and see how he&rsquo;d take
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberta looked disappointed. &ldquo;Then
Georgia Ames can only live till midyears.
Well,&rdquo; she added, brightening, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot
of time left before that, and, since she can&rsquo;t
live long, you must make her live fast, Madeline.
Why, I can think of hundreds of lovely
things you might do with her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;She certainly
has splendid possibilities. Don&rsquo;t you remember
our talk about second selves? But you
see I&rsquo;ve rather lost interest in her, because I&rsquo;m
so dreadfully busy. Betty was right about
second selves being more bother than help.
I really haven&rsquo;t the leisure to manage
Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, what a splendid time you must
have!&rdquo; sighed Roberta. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine
being too busy to manage a second self.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Madeline laughed. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so particularly
lucky,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;except in being
born easily amused. That&rsquo;s one of the advantages
of being born in Bohemia. But I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;m fickle. It&rsquo;s always &lsquo;the last the
best&rsquo; with me, and just now &lsquo;the last&rsquo; is
mushrooms. I&rsquo;m studying them with Miss
Stevens,&mdash;the new botany assistant, you know,&mdash;and
they&rsquo;re fascinating, not to mention their
being very good to eat. I&rsquo;m going to give a
mushroom party next week for &lsquo;The Merry
Hearts.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d thought of turning Georgia over
to them, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; laughed Roberta. &ldquo;You
mean you&rsquo;re going to let her join and be one
of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. &ldquo;If Bob Parker doesn&rsquo;t
black-ball her. Bob&rsquo;s rather exclusive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but she&rsquo;ll never black-ball Georgia,&rdquo;
declared Roberta, earnestly. &ldquo;Such a distinguished&mdash;what
class does she belong to,
Madeline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline considered. &ldquo;Freshman, I should
say, with a little work passed up, so as to account
for her taking some upper-class studies.
If she weren&rsquo;t a freshman she&rsquo;d seem like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>nonentity, wouldn&rsquo;t she, as she isn&rsquo;t known at
all yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as a matter of fact,&rdquo; laughed Roberta,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s as far as possible from being a nonentity.
She&rsquo;s the prod. who&rsquo;s succeeded in
exciting the wonderful Dr. Eaton. And in
general she&rsquo;s very literary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; agreed Madeline gravely. &ldquo;In
fact pen and paper are the very essence of her
being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeline,&rdquo; asked Roberta after a little
pause, &ldquo;are you going to let &lsquo;The Merry
Hearts&rsquo; use Georgia themselves, or are you
just going to tell them about her? Because I
should like to use her once before you&rsquo;ve told
the others. I&rsquo;ve thought of a lovely way,
only, if Mary Brooks knew about her, it
wouldn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Madeline briefly. &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;ve invented something that can be used to
tease Mary Brooks, I shall feel like a public
benefactor. Georgia is yours till further notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A day or two later Betty, Madeline, Katherine
and Helen were in Roberta&rsquo;s room eating
fudge and discussing the forthcoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>junior elections. Rachel Morrison was being
discussed for class president, and the question
before the house was: Should her friends
push her now or should they advise keeping
her for the greater honor of the senior presidency?
It was a difficult question, and not
half the pros and cons had been set forth when
Mary Brooks knocked on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; she said, surveying the assembly
with stern disapproval, &ldquo;are you having a
fudge party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a party,&rdquo; corrected Katherine.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a political meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mary, appropriating the Morris
chair and the fudge pan. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t save her,&rdquo; advised Mary. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
save any one. It&rsquo;s dangerous. Just look at
me; I&rsquo;ve been saved for president&mdash;ever since
freshman year. I wasn&rsquo;t quite dignified
enough then, and I wasn&rsquo;t quite pretty enough
for sophomore year. Junior year I didn&rsquo;t
want it, because chairman of the prom. committee
is so much more fun; and now it&rsquo;s decreed
that I must manage the senior play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the &lsquo;Argus,&rsquo;&rdquo; added Betty. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>shouldn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d been saved, Mary. I
should think you&rsquo;d been pretty thoroughly
used up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, put it as you like,&rdquo; said Mary modestly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done quite a bit of work in my
time, I suppose. But your speaking of the
&lsquo;Argus,&rsquo; Betty, reminds me of something. Do
any of you know a girl named Georgia Ames?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard of her,&rdquo; said Katherine
promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; chimed in Helen, who prided herself
on knowing everybody that no one else
knew. &ldquo;Which class is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least
idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline was sitting on the couch between
Roberta and Betty. At a violent nudge from
Roberta she came out of a brown study and
entered the conversation. &ldquo;What did you
say, Mary?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Mary repeated her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know her,&rdquo; said Madeline, with a
fine assumption of indifference. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
freshman, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is,&rdquo; chimed in Roberta, following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>Madeline&rsquo;s lead. &ldquo;I remember the name
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t she take some upper-class
work, Roberta?&rdquo; asked Madeline, elaborately
avoiding Roberta&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s in
something with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;English Essayists, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; suggested
Roberta cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it can&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo; objected Betty.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in your division, and I know every girl
in the class. I should have noticed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she cuts a lot,&rdquo; suggested Mary.
&ldquo;They say Dr. Eaton never calls the roll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t do that with all the ten-minute
tests,&rdquo; argued Betty. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
generally call the roll, but he&rsquo;s liable to spring
one of those tests any time, so it&rsquo;s not safe to
cut very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bgap">&ldquo;Georgia Ames doesn&rsquo;t cut,&rdquo; said Madeline
decidedly, &ldquo;and if she isn&rsquo;t in &lsquo;Essayists&rsquo; she
must be in some other junior English course.
Just the other day when I was getting back
my themes I noticed two of hers in the junior
box.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img id="Illo1" class="box" src="images/i_058.jpg" width="400" alt="&ldquo;GEORGIA AMES DOESN'T CUT,&rdquo; SAID MADELINE" title="" /></div>

<p class="center caption">&ldquo;GEORGIA AMES DOESN&rsquo;T CUT,&rdquo; SAID MADELINE</p>

<p class="gap">&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen Adams
eagerly. &ldquo;How funny! Because I met you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>just as you were going off with your papers,
and when I looked only mine and Betty&rsquo;s
were left in the pile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then probably I mixed them with some
other class&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Madeline coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awfully careless when I go to get papers. I&rsquo;ll
look them up and give them to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be more than glad to get them, I
guess,&rdquo; ventured Roberta, &ldquo;because Professor
Eaton puts such nice things on her work. I
saw one of her ten-minute themes, and the
comment was awfully flattering,&mdash;all about
clever phrasing and original thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; said Mary, sitting up suddenly
and surrendering the fudge pan to Betty.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so relieved! My department in the
&lsquo;Argus&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t half made up for this month,
and perhaps she&rsquo;ll help me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you hear of her?&rdquo; asked Helen
curiously. She was very much interested in
the workings of the &ldquo;Argus,&rdquo; board, though
she would not have admitted it, even to
Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t hear of her,&rdquo; answered Mary.
&ldquo;She put a theme on the bulletin board for
me. You know the grand new policy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&lsquo;Argus&rsquo; is to solicit as little material as possible,
but to ask people to send things to us,
instead. Have you seen our big new sign on
the societies&rsquo; bulletin board? It was Miss
Mills&rsquo;s idea. She thought it would bring out
a lot of new talent, and make the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;
more representative and democratic. It&rsquo;s a
splendid theory, but about this time in the
month, when the printer is clamoring for
copy, we have to drop our theories and apply
to the same old standbys. It&rsquo;s queer how the
people who want to write are generally just
the people who can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But apparently there are exceptions,&rdquo; objected
Betty. &ldquo;Miss Ames&mdash;is that her name?&mdash;wants
to write, or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have
sent you her theme; and she can write, or
Dr. Eaton wouldn&rsquo;t think so. I suppose you
know that he&rsquo;s awfully hard to suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope I can use her kind contribution,&rdquo;
said Mary, rising. &ldquo;The note she sent
with it was rather silly, I thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On her way to dinner Madeline overtook
Mary on the stairs. &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was what?&ldquo; asked Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Georgia&rsquo;s theme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was hopeless&mdash;perfectly hopeless,&rdquo; declared
Mary savagely. &ldquo;How Dr. Eaton can
see anything in her work is more than I can
understand. Oh, dear, you know her, don&rsquo;t
you? I hope she isn&rsquo;t a particular friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughed Madeline, &ldquo;only a sort
of protégée. Besides, what is the use of mincing
matters? I hope you&rsquo;ll tell her frankly
what you think of her literary aspirations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already written to her,&rdquo; explained
Mary, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afraid I wasn&rsquo;t exactly frank.
Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s easy to make a mistake
in such matters, when you don&rsquo;t know the
girl? She might be timid and easily discouraged&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; put in Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow she may not be a good
judge of her own work, and may have sent
me the worst when she meant to send the
best. So I just told her that her contribution
didn&rsquo;t exactly meet our needs. It was poetry,
Madeline. Fancy a &lsquo;Song of Sleep&rsquo; by a
freshman! I said I was sorry, but we had a
lot of verse on hand (we have, you know, but
it&rsquo;s all Marion Lustig&rsquo;s, and we can&rsquo;t run her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>in every single month), and I advised her to
try prose next time. I said I thought it
would suit her style better, and that I hoped
to hear from her again soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sweet,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;but I have
an idea that Georgia may see through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Mary. &ldquo;You
have no idea how easy it is to take people in,
especially freshmen. By the way, Madeline,
where does Miss Ames live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline hesitated. &ldquo;Why, I really don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where do freshmen live
this year? She&rsquo;s in one of the big off-campus
houses, I suppose. You&rsquo;d better ask
Roberta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Roberta hadn&rsquo;t the least idea where
Miss Ames lived. &ldquo;I know her awfully well,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s about the best friend
of a friend of mine; but I haven&rsquo;t got around
to call yet. Perhaps I could find out for you,
Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no matter,&rdquo; Mary assured her.
&ldquo;I can just put the bundle on the bulletin
board with her class on it; but I thought it
would look friendly and interested to put on
the address.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Georgia wouldn&rsquo;t care a bit about that,&rdquo;
declared Roberta. &ldquo;She never notices little
things. She&rsquo;s rather dense, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; interposed Madeline indignantly.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve found her quite the reverse,&mdash;and
very interesting,&mdash;the little I&rsquo;ve
seen of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t write,&rdquo; said Mary with decision,
and being extremely near-sighted she
missed the rapturous exchange of glances that
passed between the two conspirators.</p>

<p>A week later &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; were
in Betty&rsquo;s room, celebrating Rachel&rsquo;s election
to the class presidency. They had taken
Mary&rsquo;s advice and decided to let senior year
shift for itself. Mary had sent word that she
couldn&rsquo;t get around until late in the evening.
Her own sketch department in the &ldquo;Argus&rdquo;
was made up, but the literary editor still
needed a &ldquo;semi-heavy&rdquo; (which is the Harding
editors&rsquo; slang for a light essay); and, in
return for many similar favors, Mary had
joined her in a house-to-house canvas for an
available argumentative or a Carlyle paper.
It was nine o&rsquo;clock when she arrived at the
presidential spread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find it?&rdquo; asked Betty, taking her
wraps.</p>

<p>Mary nodded. &ldquo;Such as it is. I wanted
to give up and use a story, but Nora said it
wouldn&rsquo;t do at all; every exchange from Boston
to San Francisco would have an article
about the frothy foam that the Harding
&lsquo;Argus&rsquo; was printing. Roberta, you know
you can write. Why don&rsquo;t you do us some
essays? They are a lot easier to write than
stories. You just have to look up your subject
and think of a clever beginning and a few
sketchy sentences that Dr. Eaton would call
suggestive because they don&rsquo;t mean anything
in particular. I can&rsquo;t see why more of the
literary crowd doesn&rsquo;t go in for essays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have recommended essays to
Georgia Ames,&rdquo; said Madeline, with a polite
smile in Roberta&rsquo;s direction. Roberta had
told her a day or two before that Georgia had
&ldquo;tried prose,&rdquo; but she had not heard the result
of the second venture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recommended essays to Georgia Ames!&rdquo;
repeated Mary wearily. &ldquo;No, Madeline, I
don&rsquo;t believe she could even do an essay. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ought to have taken your advice and told her
plainly that she couldn&rsquo;t write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she bobbed up again?&rdquo; asked Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, with a story&mdash;novelette you might
call it, for it&rsquo;s desperately long. I brought it
with me, so that Madeline and Roberta can
see what atrocities their clever young friend
is guilty of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sudden terror froze Roberta into speechless
immobility, and she sank helplessly back
against the couch pillows, while Madeline,
shrieking with glee, demanded the whereabouts
of the manuscript, and drew it triumphantly
from Mary&rsquo;s ulster pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not read it aloud?&rdquo; asked Katherine.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t time to eat yet, and we&rsquo;ve congratulated
Rachel until she&rsquo;s tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great idea!&rdquo; assented Babe. &ldquo;I love footless
stories. Bob always reads me the ones
she writes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Bob write stories?&rdquo; cried Katherine.
&ldquo;I say, Bob&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wretch,&rdquo; cried Bob, falling upon her
accuser with the violence born of much basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>-ball
practice. &ldquo;Footless stories indeed!
You&rsquo;ll never hear another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the heat of the fray it was some time before
&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; discovered that a
double battle was going on in their midst.
While Bob pummeled Babe, Roberta was
frantically trying to wrench Georgia&rsquo;s story
from Madeline&rsquo;s firm grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing, Roberta?&rdquo;
demanded Mary. &ldquo;You can read it to
us, if you&rsquo;d rather. I know Madeline&rsquo;s voice
is bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; cried Roberta hotly,
blushing and making strange gestures in
Madeline&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a shame?&rdquo; asked Betty in perplexity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;reading my&mdash;reading Georgia&rsquo;s
story aloud and&mdash;laughing at it.&rdquo; Roberta
looked ready to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; declared Betty, uncomprehending
but sympathetic. &ldquo;How she would
feel if she knew! Truly, Mary, I don&rsquo;t wonder
that people don&rsquo;t contribute to the &lsquo;Argus,&rsquo;
if you editors show their themes around like
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Betty,&rdquo; said Mary soberly,
looking really troubled and reaching for the
manuscript. &ldquo;It was very thoughtless of me
to consent to such a thing, and I&rsquo;m heartily
ashamed. Girls, will you please promise not
to mention this to any one? And Betty, this
isn&rsquo;t the way the editors treat the unsolicited
contributions. Nora Carleton is lovely about
them, trying to see good in them all, going to
call on some of the girls, and asking Miss
Mills and Miss Raymond to try to give them
a start. Oh, it&rsquo;s not the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; editors who
act this way; it&rsquo;s just horrid, thoughtless me.&rdquo;
Mary&rsquo;s rare fit of contrition had taken a
serious hold upon her.</p>

<p>But Madeline had suffered too much from
Mary to have any mercy upon her now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sentimental, Mary,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and give me back that paper. I won&rsquo;t read
it aloud&mdash;honor bright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. &ldquo;No, and&rdquo;&mdash;her
voice quivered&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought
to have asked, Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Madeline coolly.
&ldquo;Well, I presume I haven&rsquo;t a very high code
of honor, but, leaving that aside for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>moment, I know Georgia, and I&rsquo;m sure that
she&rsquo;d be pleased and proud to have one of her
stories read aloud at a select gathering of
juniors like this. And as for my seeing it,
I&rsquo;ve seen every word that Georgia has written
this year excepting this story and the poem
she sent you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; began Mary, obviously
weakened by Madeline&rsquo;s calm argument, &ldquo;I
suppose there wouldn&rsquo;t be any great harm in
your reading it. But you&rsquo;d better wait and
let her show it to you herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Roberta, finding her
voice again. She would almost as soon have
had her story read aloud as subjected to Madeline&rsquo;s
cool, merciless laughter. &ldquo;I think the
meanest thing of all is to show a girl&rsquo;s best
friends how silly she is,&rdquo; concluded Roberta
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; said Madeline with mock
solemnity, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you forgetting what Georgia
owes to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberta&rsquo;s sense of justice was very strong.
She hesitated an instant, then submitted to
the propriety of Madeline&rsquo;s claim. &ldquo;Yes,
Madeline,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I forgot. I know&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>is, it&rsquo;s all right for Madeline to see it, Mary.
I shouldn&rsquo;t say so if I weren&rsquo;t sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline retired triumphantly to a corner
with the manuscript, of which she meant to
read just enough to tease Roberta about later;
and Betty, who felt that the presidential spread
was being too much engrossed with the affairs
of an obscure freshman, turned the thoughts
of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; into safer channels.</p>

<p>But Mary&rsquo;s pensive melancholy persisted,
in spite of Katherine&rsquo;s raillery and Roberta&rsquo;s
kindly attentions. Mary took much satisfaction
in being what she called &ldquo;a scholar and
a gentleman.&rdquo; She was very proud of her
place on the &ldquo;Argus&rdquo; board, and even prouder
of the consideration paid her by her &ldquo;little
friends,&rdquo; as she dubbed the rest of &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts.&rdquo; Now she felt that she had
forfeited their respect, and at the same time
played false to the trust which an &ldquo;Argus&rdquo;
editorship involved. She did no justice to
the creamy marsh-mallow fudge, took no part
in the gay banter that gives the Harding
spread its peculiar charm. And Roberta
watched her with growing compunction.
Mary was her idol. She had meant to win
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>her point, but she had never contemplated
hurting Mary&rsquo;s feelings. She stood it as long
as she could, then strolled casually over to
Madeline&rsquo;s corner, and the two held a whispered
conference.</p>

<p>Madeline listened, laughed, and swept the
story into a neat pile. With it in one hand
and arm in arm with Roberta, she advanced
to Mary&rsquo;s seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; she said with a low bow, &ldquo;to
present you with this rejected manuscript
(which, by the way, Roberta, is stunningly
good in spots), and also with a busted bubble,
namely, Roberta Lewis&rsquo;s literary career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Roberta eagerly. &ldquo;Now I
hope you&rsquo;ll stop telling me to write. That&rsquo;s my
story, and the &lsquo;Song of Sleep&rsquo; was mine too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s surprise fairly overwhelmed
her. &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t any matter about your offering
to let us read it. That is, I mean I deserved
to have you,&rdquo; added Roberta, cheerfully
intent on making her sacrifice complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here Roberta, be careful,&rdquo; cried Madeline.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re letting her off too easily. Come on,
girls, and help me to rub it in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; did not cease to &ldquo;rub
it in&rdquo; on all occasions, convenient or otherwise,
as long as Mary stayed at Harding
College.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<small><small>GEORGIA BECOMES A &ldquo;MERRY HEART&rdquo;</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a Saturday night in late October,
and Madeline Ayres was giving &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; their long promised and much anticipated
mushroom party. Madeline&rsquo;s room was
really no larger than Betty&rsquo;s, but much experience
of living in trunks and tiny apartments
had given her a really marvelous skill
in the art of making the small appear the
larger space. Her wash-stand was hidden in
the closet. There also was the steamer-trunk,
which, with a bed box that slid neatly under
the couch, took the place of a bulky chiffonier.
The litter of small bric-a-brac,&mdash;of dance and
dinner cards and other miscellaneous souvenirs
of good times or journeys,&mdash;that fill the
room of the average college girl to overflowing,
had no place at all in Madeline&rsquo;s scheme of
life. There were a few pictures&mdash;several small
water color landscapes, gifts of her father&rsquo;s artist
friends, a black and white reproduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>of a famous painter&rsquo;s conception of the college
girl, with a dainty pen-and-ink sketch done
by the great man himself on the wide gold
mat, and a little Japanese print of Fuji-yama
in a curiously carved sandal-wood frame.
The couch cover she had brought from Bagdad
herself, and the one tall green vase bore
the imprint of a famous French potter. As
Betty Wales said once with a sigh, it was easy
enough for Madeline to leave out the &ldquo;footless
little things,&rdquo; when she had such lovely big
ones.</p>

<p>So there was plenty of space in Madeline&rsquo;s
room for giving an elaborate spread, and most
elaborate was the mushroom party that she
had provided for &ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo; Babbie
Hildreth&rsquo;s stunning chafing-dish, with the
four copper rabbits standing on their hind
legs and looking inquiringly over the edge of
the pan, occupied the place of honor on the
tea-table. Babbie&rsquo;s chafing-dish was the envy
of the whole college. She had bought it with
the money that her mother had sent for the
term&rsquo;s wages of the maid that Babbie was still
supposed to be keeping. It represented much
self-denial in the matter of riding-horses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>suppers at Cuyler&rsquo;s, which were Babbie&rsquo;s
favorite methods of disposing of the maid&rsquo;s
stipend; but, as Bob said, it was worth a few
rides and a good deal of starvation on campus
fare to be known as the owner of the swellest
chafing-dish in Harding.</p>

<p>Babbie&rsquo;s chafing-dish was cooking the cream
sauce for the &ldquo;inky drippers,&rdquo; so Madeline
explained to her ignorant guests. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
called that because they all turn to ink when
they&rsquo;re old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all pretty of them, I should say,&rdquo;
announced Katherine, surveying the plateful
of dainty, gray-brown morsels doubtfully. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I shall eat any &lsquo;inky drippers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll miss the very best course,&rdquo;
warned Madeline. &ldquo;Wait till you see them
done in cream, on the toast that Mary-in-the-kitchen
is going to bring up for us. They&rsquo;re
much better than creamed oysters. They&rsquo;re
going to be your meat course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline&rsquo;s own chafing-dish, placed on one
corner of her desk, was also lighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is this the first course?&rdquo; asked Rachel,
peeping inquisitively under the cover. &ldquo;Why,
it looks like oyster soup!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&mdash;oyster-mushroom soup,&rdquo; said Madeline,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the first course. Next come
the &lsquo;inky drippers&rsquo;&mdash;excuse me, K., we can
call them coprinus, if you like that name better&mdash;and
then two entrées, giant puff-balls
fried in batter, and meadow mushrooms broiled
in butter and their own juice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; sighed Mary joyously. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
it sound inviting? Think of eating an all-mushroom,
four-course supper! Isn&rsquo;t this
elegance for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of the indigestion we&rsquo;ll get,&rdquo; put in
Babbie, who was curled up on the window-seat,
industriously slicing puff-balls into the
pan of another borrowed chafing-dish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indigestion!&rdquo; repeated Babe. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind that, but suppose Madeline&rsquo;s made a
mistake about her dippers of ink&mdash;is that their
name, Madeline?&mdash;and we all die of poisoning.
Does any one know of a grudge Madeline has
against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo; asked Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; announced Babe proudly, &ldquo;she
might be poisoning us off the way Nero did
his friends. He used to give banquets, and
of course everybody had to eat whatever came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>along, including mushrooms; and when they
got home they died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the prodigy of learning!&rdquo; declaimed
Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you, Baby. Did you
read up mushrooms in the encyclopædia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Babe. &ldquo;I never read for
fun. I studied up Nero for a nine o&rsquo;clock
history class Monday morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t any of Nero&rsquo;s kind of
mushroom, have you, Madeline?&rdquo; asked
Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know about that to-morrow,&rdquo; cut
in Babe. &ldquo;It takes twenty-four hours to make
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And meanwhile,&rdquo; laughed Madeline,
&ldquo;you can live in hope. The soup is ready.
Betty, will you bring the bouillon cups?
They&rsquo;re tea-cups at present, and you&rsquo;d better
dust them off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soup was delicious; so were the &ldquo;inky
drippers.&rdquo; Katherine&rsquo;s prejudices went down
after the first taste. When the last morsel
of meadow-mushroom had been disposed of,
she heaved a deep sigh and voiced the sentiments
of the whole party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I hope these aren&rsquo;t the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Nero brand, but if I am ever poisoned I
want the stuff that does it to taste as good as
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mary briskly, &ldquo;while we
are waiting to find out about that, I think
we&rsquo;d better have a business meeting of &lsquo;The
Merry Hearts.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know of any business
myself, and I don&rsquo;t see how we can transact
any, with our peculiar rules and regulations;
but Madeline and Roberta have been casting
base insinuations on my fitness for the exalted
office I hold, and I am going to show them
how beautifully I could have presided over
the Congress of these United States, if I&rsquo;d only
been a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting to see you do it,&rdquo; said Madeline
placidly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t written a report,
and nobody can make a motion, but if you&rsquo;ll
please recognize me, Madame President&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it against the rules to give me a chance
to call the meeting to order first?&rdquo; inquired
Mary with great dignity. &ldquo;Now, Miss Ayres,
if &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; will please come to order,
you may have the floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no
hurry at all, only I wanted to ask the girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>how they feel about taking in some new
members,&mdash;or one new member at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Each of &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rdquo; thought instantly of Eleanor
Watson, the only one of the Chapin House
crowd who was not a member of the club.
Though few of them knew the whole story of
her sophomore year, they all understood the
opposition of the B&rsquo;s and Nita, and wondered
why Madeline should care to defy it. Katherine
Kittredge went a step further than the rest
in her conjectures. Remembering how Betty
had stood by Eleanor and how eager she was
for the rest of the clan to know and like her
too, she decided instantly that Betty, having
won Madeline to her view, had persuaded her
to suggest Eleanor for membership. She
looked at Betty and utterly misinterpreted
her distressed expression. For Betty, like the
rest, thought that Madeline meant to propose
Eleanor and was sure that her doing so just
then was mistaken kindness. Katherine&rsquo;s
championship of Eleanor hitherto had been
on Betty&rsquo;s account, and now it was for Betty&rsquo;s
sake that she broke the hostile silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a rule against discussions, Mary?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>she began, with an attempt at ease and
hilarity. &ldquo;I suppose we are all waiting because
we are afraid you will call us down with
one of your grand regulations. But seriously,
Madeline, I&rsquo;m sure this silence doesn&rsquo;t mean
opposition to your idea. It merely indicates
deep thought. You see we are so fond of one
another, and we feel so complete and nicely
fixed just as we are, that we can&rsquo;t grasp your
point. Tell as why you think we need a new
member.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Madeline, smiling reassuringly
at Betty, who still looked greatly troubled,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we exactly need any more
members than we have. It&rsquo;s quite obvious
that, if we&rsquo;re to meet here and in Betty&rsquo;s
room, we can&rsquo;t enlarge our boundaries very
much. But of course there are some awfully
jolly girls at Harding who aren&rsquo;t in this
crowd. There was, for example, me,&mdash;before
you took me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; broke in Babe impatiently, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
you hurry up and tell us whom you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Bob, and
stopped short, blushing violently and hoping
no one had understood. But fortunately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>several people had, and the atmosphere grew
suddenly less tense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Babe,&rdquo; asked Madeline,
&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s rather hard on my friend,&mdash;for of
course she is a friend of mine,&mdash;to make me
tell her name before we&rsquo;ve decided whether or
not we want any one else in &lsquo;The Merry
Hearts&rsquo;? If she&rsquo;s sure to be turned down,
why, there&rsquo;s no use in dragging her name in at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good point,&rdquo; said Katherine, wondering
if she could possibly have been mistaken
and in a great hurry to find out the truth;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure we can settle it quickly enough.
If we could find any one that we liked as
much as we do Madeline Ayres,&mdash;the same
jolly good sort&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My second self, for instance, if she ever
enters Harding,&rdquo; interpolated Madeline smilingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You peacock!&rdquo; laughed Rachel, glad to
see that Madeline felt no embarrassment over
the strained situation. &ldquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s decided,
without being moved and seconded,
that we may sometime make additions to our
society. Isn&rsquo;t that right, girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; agreed rather half-heartedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Madeline,&rdquo; said Babe. &ldquo;Now
fire away. What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume you won&rsquo;t want her,&rdquo; said
Madeline calmly, &ldquo;but if there&rsquo;s any hope&mdash;it&rsquo;s
Georgia Ames, a freshman friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another dead silence, but this
one was less oppressive. As long as Madeline
had not proposed Eleanor Watson, they all
felt less embarrassed. As for Georgia Ames,
nobody but Roberta and Mary remembered
anything about her, and Mary&rsquo;s recollection
was only a vague feeling that she had heard
the name before. As soon as she had found
out that &ldquo;Georgia Ames&rdquo; was Roberta, she
had lost all interest in the name; and the
rest had not noticed it at all, supposing naturally
that it had no significance except as
Roberta&rsquo;s nom de plume. Roberta and Madeline
had observed this indifference to Georgia&rsquo;s
personality, and had agreed between themselves
to keep silent until the right time came for
Georgia&rsquo;s introduction to &ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Betty who finally ended the second
long pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a nice name!&rdquo; she said, with a glad
little sigh of relief. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her even
by sight, Madeline. Tell us all about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t any of you heard of her?&rdquo; asked
Madeline, with an effective stare of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; answered Roberta solemnly. &ldquo;She
is a very remarkable freshman, Betty, and I
don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t have met her,
for she takes a good deal of upper-class work,&mdash;&lsquo;English
Essayists&rsquo; for one thing. Dr. Eaton
says that her written work is fine. I saw one
of her ten-minute tests, and the comment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter from Mary,
in which the rest of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
joined, one after another, as each saw the
joke, or thought she saw it. Roberta stared
at them in what seemed to be wondering,
reproachful silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; said Mary, when she could
speak for laughing, &ldquo;how many mysterious
freshmen do you and Madeline know, who
take &lsquo;English Essayists&rsquo; and get fulsome compliments
from Dr. Eaton? This is the second
one we&rsquo;ve heard of lately. Is this one a joke
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary Brooks,&rdquo; cried Helen all at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>once, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t the second one we&rsquo;ve heard
of. It&rsquo;s the first. That is, I mean they are
both the same. Don&rsquo;t you remember that
Roberta signed &lsquo;Georgia Ames&rsquo; to those
things she sent to the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hubbub of exclamations and
questions, and it was some time before Madeline
could tell the story of how Georgia began
in Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s class, and of her subsequent
career there and as contributor to the &ldquo;Argus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve proved my
point, that a second self is sure to be interesting.
But I&rsquo;ve also proved Betty&rsquo;s, that it&rsquo;s a
great deal of trouble to keep one up. I really
haven&rsquo;t time between now and midyears to
develop Georgia&rsquo;s full possibilities, and so I
thought &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; might like to
use her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame President,&rdquo; said Rachel, &ldquo;I move&mdash;I
mean, will you please instruct the secretary
to cast a unanimous ballot for Georgia
Ames as a member in good and regular standing
of &lsquo;The Merry Hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame President,&rdquo; added Katherine,
&ldquo;will you please instruct the secretary to
indite a formal note of thanks to Miss Made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>line
Ayres for giving us such a fine mushroom
party&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better wait till to-morrow, so you can be
sure they were all fine,&rdquo; murmured Babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And also for hunting up such a valuable
new member,&rdquo; went on Katherine.</p>

<p>When the president had carried out these
instructions, Betty Wales, being a strictly unimaginative
person, ventured a question. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t exactly understand what we&rsquo;re to do
with Georgia Ames,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are we just
to have the honor of belonging to the same
club with her, or are we to use her as Roberta
did, or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, use her by all means,&rdquo; said Madeline
generously. &ldquo;She is spoiling to be used.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we must be careful not to tell any
one else about her,&rdquo; cautioned Rachel. &ldquo;If
too many people know who she is, she will be
spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of girl is she supposed to be?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Literary,&rdquo; explained Roberta, &ldquo;and clever
and&mdash;what else, Madeline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that remains to be discovered,&rdquo; said
Madeline with a shrug. &ldquo;See what you can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>make of her. But whatever you make of her,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;be sure that you keep Dr. Eaton
interested. The cream of the joke, you know,
will be seeing what he says when Miss Stuart
confides to him how he&rsquo;s been fooled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll never know what he said,&rdquo;
suggested Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we shall,&rdquo; declared Mary. &ldquo;Betty
can ask her. Betty and she have been great
friends ever since that time when she didn&rsquo;t
meet Betty at the station. By the way, Betty
Wales, how is it that you always manage to get
the things you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; insisted Mary. &ldquo;You
said the word and &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; turned
philanthropic. There was Bob and the Hilton
House toads, and this morning I caught Babe
being nice to that queer Miss Ray on the way
out of chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I wasn&rsquo;t always nice to everybody,&rdquo;
muttered Babe shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want to know&rdquo;&mdash;Mary went on&mdash;&ldquo;is
how you do it. It would be very useful
to me in my business if I could wind people
around my little finger the way you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; protested Betty,
blushing happily. She would have liked to
think that she had an influence over her
friends, but she couldn&rsquo;t believe it. She was
only &ldquo;little Betty Wales,&rdquo; who was not noted
for anything in particular, and was always
being taken for a freshman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call her the &lsquo;Power Behind the
Throne,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she
is, and she gets the things she wants because
she never teases for them the way you do,
President Brooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many thanks for the hint, Secretary
Ayres,&rdquo; said Mary affably. &ldquo;I am now requested
by our hostess to announce that she
would like her dishes washed before ten
o&rsquo;clock. I must go this minute, but the rest
of you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bar the door!&rdquo; shouted Bob, &ldquo;and hold
her tight! She&rsquo;s got to help this time, for
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the business meeting of &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rdquo; adjourned suddenly and in
some disorder.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<small><small>A TOUCH OF STYLE AND SOME OTHER TOUCHES</small></small></h2></div>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Merry Hearts</span>&rdquo; lost no time in arranging
the details of what Babbie called Georgia&rsquo;s
coming-out party. Various methods of
bringing her to public notice were discussed,
but it was finally decided that each &ldquo;Merry
Heart&rdquo; should do whatever her individual
taste and inclination suggested, only each
must add some touch, however slight, to the
sum total of Georgia&rsquo;s achievements, report
what she had done at the next ensuing meeting
of the society, and be very careful not to
divulge the secret of Georgia&rsquo;s personality to
any outsider.</p>

<p>Then the fun began. It was curious to see
how each girl&rsquo;s personality came out in the
way she manipulated Madeline&rsquo;s second self.
The B&rsquo;s, as was to be expected, contributed
touches of style. Babbie immediately ordered
a card plate for Georgia, with a hundred cards
engraved according to the latest decree of fash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ion.
Watching her opportunity she slipped
one under the door of a Westcott House senior
who made a specialty of cultivating freshman
friendships. The mystified senior inquired
busily for two days without eliciting any
definite information as to the identity of her
caller, and Georgia&rsquo;s name became very familiar
to the Westcott House girls.</p>

<p>A day or two later a huge box of violets arrived
by special messenger for Miss Georgia
Ames. The parlor-maid was new to the ways
of the house (this Bob had counted upon in
ordering the flowers), and without looking at
the name on the box, she laid it on the table
in the front hall. There it stayed all day,
stared at and sighed over by envious passersby,
who easily guessed the character of its
contents and lamented that, having been sent
to the wrong address, a bunch of violets as big
as this one must hide its sweetness under a
bushel.</p>

<p>After dinner, while the girls lingered in the
hall and parlors, as was their custom, Bob engaged
in conversation the senior who had
been the recipient of Babbie&rsquo;s card and carelessly
led her toward the hall table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Violets!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as if she had
spied the box for the first time. &ldquo;Whom do
you suppose they&rsquo;re for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senior, who was accustomed to being
deluged with flowers by her freshman admirers,
hastened up to the table. &ldquo;Georgia
Ames,&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;Why, how funny! That&rsquo;s
the girl who called on me the other day, and
I haven&rsquo;t been able to find out who she is or
where she lives. But she certainly doesn&rsquo;t
live in this house. Isn&rsquo;t it a perfect shame to
have those violets wasted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Bob, who intended to creep
down and confiscate the box after ten. &ldquo;But
what can we do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senior considered a moment, and then
her face brightened. &ldquo;Why, find out who
sent them, of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and telephone
her to send an A. D. T. boy after them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bob, who knew well that
there was no card inside the box. The string
was badly knotted, and Bob insisted upon untying
it with the greatest care, so that it could
be replaced later. With her fingers on the
last knot she paused and looked up at the
senior anxiously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>wrong,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to look at the card in another
person&rsquo;s box of flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, under the circumstances,&rdquo;
said the senior acidly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only doing as
you&rsquo;d be done by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends on the card, I should say,&rdquo;
murmured Bob under cover of the rustling
paper. A moment later she looked up smilingly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not so bad after all,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any card. Do you suppose Miss
Ames is engaged or only awfully popular?
Anonymous flowers mean one thing or the
other, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, but we can telephone to the
florist,&rdquo; said the senior eagerly. &ldquo;I really
must find out her address, you know. She&rsquo;s
almost sure to be interesting, or she wouldn&rsquo;t
be getting such stunning violets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob had covered her trail well. The florist
replied that the order had been brought in by
a messenger boy, the name and address written
on a card. Had he still the card? Yes, but
the address was very illegible. It looked more
like Westcott House than anything else. He
was sorry, but there seemed to be no way of
locating Miss Ames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob, waiting to hear the result of the conversation
from the senior&rsquo;s own lips, was joined
by Roberta, who had come over to the Westcott
on an errand, and together they listened
to the senior&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done your best,&rdquo;
Roberta assured her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to waste
the violets. Why don&rsquo;t you take them, since
she&rsquo;s a friend of yours&mdash;or an acquaintance
any way? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve fairly earned
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senior looked doubtfully at Bob, who
was glaring stonily at Roberta. &ldquo;Yes, take
them by all means,&rdquo; said Bob sweetly. &ldquo;Oh,
no, I don&rsquo;t want any. A bunch like that
costs three dollars and eighty cents, if you
care to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the senior mounted the stairs with her
treasure, Bob turned wrathfully upon Roberta.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a base traitor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I shall
get even with you sooner or later. But I
guess I had my money&rsquo;s worth in spite of you,&rdquo;
she added with a grin. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Georgia the
best ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senior spread the story of the violets
widely among her circle of friends. She even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>declared her intention of going to the registrar
for Georgia&rsquo;s address; but there were a great
many other freshmen in the entering class
that year, and she never went.</p>

<p>Nita&rsquo;s &ldquo;touch&rdquo; stirred up the whole Hilton
House, and caused Nita herself endless trouble.
The picture post-card fad was at its height and
Nita was making a collection. Writing to
thank an aunt who had sent her a number
of foreign cards, she bethought herself of
Georgia, and added a postscript. &ldquo;A lot of
the girls here are making collections of cards.
Some day when you have time do send
one to Georgia Ames (address, Harding
College, Harding). She is always doing me
favors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The aunt responded promptly, and as there
was no Georgia Ames in Harding, at least according
to the postal register, the card went to
the Hilton, with &ldquo;Try Georgiana Arms,&rdquo;
written across it. The aunt had unfortunately
seen fit to indite an explanatory line or two
below the picture, and Georgiana Arms read
it. &ldquo;My niece, Nita Reese,&rdquo; wrote the
aunt, &ldquo;begs me to send you this card in token
of the many favors you have done her. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>need not say that my niece&rsquo;s friends are
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Georgiana Arms, who had barely a speaking
acquaintance with Nita, realized that the
card could not be meant for her, and seeing
Nita in the library soon after, she took it out
of her philosophy note-book, where she had
stored it for safekeeping, and asked Nita for
the right address.</p>

<p>Nita was fairly caught. She had meant to
create an interest in Georgia, but she had not
considered the possibility of having to explain
her own interest in the elusive freshman.
She read the post-card slowly, trying to gain
time and evolve some way of escape, and
finally passed it back to Miss Arms. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t any such girl in college as far as I know,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what the mail-man told
me,&rdquo; answered Miss Arms. &ldquo;But I thought&mdash;why,
your aunt says you asked her to send
this Miss Ames a post-card. I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mistake,&rdquo; Nita equivocated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean she isn&rsquo;t your aunt?&rdquo; demanded
Miss Arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s my aunt, fast enough,&rdquo; laughed
Nita, &ldquo;but she misunderstood about this
Georgia Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Miss Arms doubtfully. &ldquo;Well,
do you want the card?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Nita politely, though the
card was a beauty. &ldquo;Keep it by all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Arms looked hard at it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite
sure it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; Nita assured her. &ldquo;My aunt&mdash;well,
she&rsquo;s a trifle eccentric, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Miss Arms, and this time she
spoke with great positiveness. She confided
to a group of her particular friends a little
later that she had always wondered why Nita
Reese was so funny about some things, and
now she had found out. There was insanity
in the family,&mdash;&ldquo;Eccentricity, she calls it,&rdquo;
explained Miss Arms, and then told the story
of the post-card. One of her friends lived at
the Westcott, and consequently knew about
Georgia&rsquo;s violets. There were exciting comparisons,
and Georgia&rsquo;s boom grew amazingly.</p>

<p>Two days later Miss Arms&rsquo;s theory of the
situation, already shaken by the violet story,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>received a fatal blow. It was proved to her
full satisfaction that Georgia Ames was no
figment of an &ldquo;eccentric&rdquo; aunt&rsquo;s imagination.
She existed and she went to Harding. Mary
Brooks had been to New York to see her father
and mother off for a winter in Italy, and she
sent Georgia a note, written on Waldorf-Astoria
paper and signed &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo; Miss
Arms opened it before she noticed the address,
and read it through in growing bewilderment.
Then she looked again at the envelope, and
saw Georgia Ames&rsquo;s name. She consulted
Nita, who disclaimed any particular interest
in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that my aunt was mistaken?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect me to
know all the &lsquo;Marys&rsquo; who stay at the Waldorf.
It does seem to me that the name Georgia
Ames is on Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s English Essayists roll,
but I&rsquo;ve never even seen the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton was by no means neglected by
&ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo; Babe, sacrificing her
prettiest handkerchief to the cause, marked it
carefully with indelible ink, and as she
passed out of her English recitation dropped
it carelessly on the professor&rsquo;s desk. From a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>dark corner of the hall she watched him pick
it up, look at the mark, and consult Jean
Eastman, who was the last person to leave the
class that morning, about its owner.</p>

<p>Jean evidently assured him that there was
no such person in the class, for he presently
took out his roll-call and pointed out the last
name on the list. Jean looked amazed, and
Babe heard her asking the girls in front of
her if they knew any Georgia Ames who
carried handkerchiefs with real lace on them
and took English Essayists.</p>

<p>But it was Helen Chase Adams who made
the crowning hit, as far as Dr. Eaton was concerned.
Unfortunately for his classes, Dr.
Eaton did not tire of the ten-minute test.
He still resorted to it with unbecoming frequency,
and his students were obliged to
endure as best they might his remarkable
zest for extracting information. So Helen
conceived the idea of having Georgia&rsquo;s mother
remonstrate with him on the score of danger
to her daughter&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was great fun composing it,&rdquo; Helen explained
to Betty, &ldquo;though I did feel a little
like a forger. But I don&rsquo;t suppose there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>any Mrs. Erasmus J. Ames in the world. Do
you think Dr. Eaton will answer it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Betty eagerly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very
punctilious about little things, I&rsquo;ve noticed.
But how can you get the answer? What
address did you give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just Harding. I wrote as if I was visiting
Georgia. Let&rsquo;s go to the office and inquire
for Mrs. Erasmus J. Ames&rsquo;s mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s answer was waiting.
Helen read it to &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
that evening.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Ames</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I appreciate your interest in
your daughter&rsquo;s college work and also in her
health, permit me to say that I think you
over-estimate the nervous strain imposed by
the necessity for producing a brief written exercise.
Your daughter&rsquo;s work is so brilliant
and likewise so spontaneous that I feel sure
you need not be anxious about her. I regret
her recent absence from the class on my own
account as well as on hers. I remain, madam,</p>

<p class="right2">&ldquo;Most respectfully,</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Elliot Eaton</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;how is that for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>subtle flattery and sugar-coated sarcasm?
&lsquo;Madam, you are a goose, but you have a
clever daughter,&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he virtually
says. How I detest that man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too hard on him, Madeline,&rdquo;
laughed Rachel. &ldquo;Consider what he says
about your work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Georgia&rsquo;s, you mean,&rdquo; corrected Madeline.
&ldquo;He never puts good comments on my own
themes. He is like all the rest of the faculty;
once get him interested, as Georgia did with
her Matthew Arnold theories, and you are
safe from conditions forever after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean about her &lsquo;recent absence&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I want to know,&rdquo; said Madeline.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you girls been handing in
her ten-minute tests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;That
is your &lsquo;touch.&rsquo; You began it, and we
couldn&rsquo;t keep it up even if we wanted to.
We can&rsquo;t any of us write one decent theme
in ten minutes, to say nothing to doing
two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; began Madeline grudgingly,
&ldquo;I suppose I must attend to Georgia&rsquo;s written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>work. But I consider that it&rsquo;s putting a great
deal off on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she yours to begin with?&rdquo; demanded
Mary. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting all the
fun of what we do for her, and won&rsquo;t she
always be known in Harding history as your
second self?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline smiled genially. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
in that, perhaps,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do certainly
like the way you&rsquo;re bringing her out.
Before she joined &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; she was
just clever and literary. Now she has style
and social position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a real lace handkerchief,&rdquo; murmured
Babe, &ldquo;that Dr. Eaton never took to the &lsquo;Lost
and Found&rsquo; place, so I could get it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a three-dollar-and-eighty-cent-bunch
of violets,&rdquo; added Bob, with a wrathful glance
at Roberta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you hadn&rsquo;t named her father Erasmus
J.,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Still there&rsquo;s nothing
positively unpleasant about Erasmus J.,
and I rather like the idea of her having a
fussy, stupid little mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many more weeks to midyears?&rdquo;
asked Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Five to Christmas,&rdquo; said Betty, who always
counted the days from the beginning of each
term to the nearest vacation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we must make the most of them,&rdquo;
said Mary briskly. &ldquo;We shall be dreadfully
busy between Christmas and midyears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; inquired Helen doubtfully,
&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s wrong to signs Georgia&rsquo;s name
or her mother&rsquo;s to papers or letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mary decidedly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; that
is, if we only use her for fun, and are careful
not to let her do any harm to any one. As
long as she is just a gloriously big joke, I&rsquo;m
sure she&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which presidential decision &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rdquo; wisely rested satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<small><small>&ldquo;THE MERRY HEARTS&rdquo; FIND WORK TO DO</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span> found out about her, of course.
As Betty said mournfully to Mary Brooks, it
was rather a shame when she never, never
cried herself, and hated dreadfully to see any
one else cry, that she should be the one who
was forever running into something of the
sort. There had been Helen Adams, Emily
Davis and Eleanor, and now there was Dora
Carlson, the very last person that you would
suspect of wearing her heart on her sleeve.</p>

<p>She was working in the college library one
afternoon, reading up for a Lit. paper, so
she whispered in answer to Betty&rsquo;s friendly
inquiry. Betty explained that she had come
to do the very same thing, and sat down across
the table from Dora in the English Literature
alcove. She noticed at once that Dora looked
very sober for such a cheerful little person,
but she attributed this to the Lit. paper,
which, in Betty&rsquo;s eyes, was a very &ldquo;sobering&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>circumstance. A little later she glanced up
from her book and smiled across at Dora just
in time to catch her wiping away a big tear.
Betty bent low over her book again, blushing
for Dora and for herself, the unwilling witness
of Dora&rsquo;s weakness. What could be the matter,
she wondered. Dora had been so happy
during her freshman year, although she had
had none of the things that the average freshman
considers essential to happiness&mdash;neither
a pretty room nor a pleasant boarding-place,
nor congenial friends, nor popularity, nor
prominence of any sort. She had had nothing
but Eleanor Watson, and that had been
enough for her. Now she had even more of
Eleanor than before, for the gentler, sweeter
side that Eleanor was developing helped her
to give more of herself to her friends; and besides
that she was up near the campus, in the
pretty room that Eleanor had helped pay for.
There were pleasant girls at the new boarding-place,
most of them freshmen probably, but
that didn&rsquo;t matter, so long as they were the
right sort. Suppose they weren&rsquo;t the right
sort?</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably it,&rdquo; Betty decided swiftly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t been nice to her, and she&rsquo;s
feeling bad about it. But it isn&rsquo;t like her
to give up and cry. Oh, how I wish she&rsquo;d
stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dora did not stop. Presently the big
tears were falling too fast for any furtive wiping away
to conceal them. The English Literature
alcove was a comparatively secluded spot, but
at any moment some one might invade its
privacy. Betty endured as long as she could.
Then she leaned across the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you stop long enough so
that you can go out?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t far to the door, and then we could go to
walk or&mdash;or&mdash;something nice, and perhaps
you&rsquo;d feel better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora thanked her with a bright little smile
that shone out, rainbow-like, from behind the
falling tears. And presently she had &ldquo;stopped
long enough&rdquo; to go out. Betty returned
Dora&rsquo;s book and her own to the librarian, and
escaped the importunate demands of Nita
Reese, who wanted to know how much she
had read and why she was stopping before her
time was up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you&rsquo;ll not get a chance at that book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>again. It&rsquo;s engaged for every single hour,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take it now, please, Nita dear, and
let me have it your hour&mdash;and let me go now.
I can&rsquo;t wait to explain.&rdquo; And Betty hurried
into the hall.</p>

<p>There Dora was waiting for her, composed
and very apologetic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely sorry
that I cried,&rdquo; she began in her funny little
matter-of-fact way. &ldquo;I could see that it made
you very nervous. It does me too, and I
never thought I should be guilty of such
childish behavior. But you see, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Her voice broke, and her lip quivered dangerously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind that now. Please&mdash;please
try to think of something else,&rdquo; begged Betty,
in desperate fear of a second shower. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she added hastily.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to Cuyler&rsquo;s and have an ice,
or a hot chocolate, if you&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just love ice cream,&rdquo; said Dora eagerly.
&ldquo;We have it every Sunday for dinner, just as
they do on the campus, and I always look forward
to Sunday dinners, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like your boarding-place?&rdquo; asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>Betty tentatively, hoping to divert Dora&rsquo;s mind
from her trouble and at the same time get a
clue to its cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; answered Dora eagerly.
&ldquo;Mrs. Tait and the girls are lovely, and my
room is just like a little nest up among the
elm branches. We don&rsquo;t have many elms
near my home, and so I appreciate them more
here, I suppose.&rdquo; She smiled gaily up at
Betty, then suddenly her face clouded and she
lapsed into sombre silence.</p>

<p>While they ate their ices at the cozy little
table for two in Cuyler&rsquo;s tea-room, Dora kept
showing the same quick change of mood.
One minute she was smilingly responsive to
Betty&rsquo;s questions; the next she had withdrawn
again into her shell, giving no hint of what had
frightened her back.</p>

<p>When they had finished, Betty lingered,
smoothing her gloves with exaggerated care
and wondering if it was safe now to venture
on a direct question. The short afternoon
had flown away. A maid was turning
on the lights, and through the window
Betty could see that it was almost dark outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be better to ask out there,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;Then if she should cry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dora did not cry. She answered Betty&rsquo;s
questions in her most matter-of-fact fashion.
It was not the girls; they had been more than
kind. It was nothing at Harding; it was the
way things had turned out at home. Her
father had hurt his hand in a harvesting
machine. There had been heavy doctor&rsquo;s
bills, and while he was still helpless a barn,
stored with the fall crops of hay and potatoes,
had burned to the ground. So he could not
afford to keep Dora at Harding any longer.
A letter had come that morning. Perhaps
next year she could come back, but at present
there was nothing to hope for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever come back,&rdquo;
said Dora sadly. &ldquo;I can have a place now in
the school of our district, and I guess that is
what I was meant for. I guess I aimed too
high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Betty assured her.
She had been thinking fast. She knew from
Rachel some of the ways of economizing at
Harding. Dora&rsquo;s tuition was paid for half the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>year, and there must be some way of providing
for the board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind earning some money?&rdquo;
she asked, &ldquo;by tutoring or&mdash;or&mdash;waiting on
table?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would do anything, even to scrubbing
floors, if I could stay,&rdquo; said Dora solemnly.
&ldquo;But you see&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;there is
Eleanor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Betty waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is paying part of my board, so that I
can be up nearer the campus. If I should
move to a cheaper place or go to work, she
would have to know.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t she know? You
ought to have told her straight off. I know she
will keep on giving you the money, and it
will help along a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Dora quickly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
take it. It would be just like breaking a will.
The money was given to me for a special purpose,
and I can&rsquo;t use it for anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You absurd child!&rdquo; laughed Betty.
&ldquo;But perhaps you won&rsquo;t have to move out of
Eleanor&rsquo;s room. The off-campus houses are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>all wanting waitresses. Wouldn&rsquo;t Mrs. Tait
let you earn something in that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dora, &ldquo;I think she would.
She needs a waitress right now, and there is a
little room up on the attic floor that would be
a lot cheaper than mine. But I couldn&rsquo;t pay
even for that&mdash;and I should have to tell
Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; said Betty
gaily. &ldquo;It would hurt her feelings dreadfully
if she knew that you had told me and not her,
when she&rsquo;s so particularly fond of you. Tell
her why you can&rsquo;t take the money any
longer, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll understand how
you feel.&rdquo; They had reached the campus
gate, and Betty caught Dora&rsquo;s arm and pulled
her in. &ldquo;Come and tell her now. There&rsquo;s
plenty of time before dinner, and you&rsquo;ll feel
better to have it over. While you are there,
I&rsquo;ll go and see Rachel about your getting
tutoring to do. May I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora consented gratefully and they parted
at the Hilton House steps.</p>

<p>The minute she had finished dinner, Betty
hurried over to Eleanor&rsquo;s room. Dora had
told her story and Eleanor took exactly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>view of it that Betty had foreseen, and had
almost prevailed upon Dora to keep her
weekly contribution toward the price of the
attic room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly move
back into my extra-priced room now,&rdquo;
Eleanor said, &ldquo;and that if she didn&rsquo;t take
the money, I should certainly burn it up, and
be very much hurt besides. I think she&rsquo;ll
take it, and it seems that Mrs. Tait, guessing
how things were, has hinted at her acting as
waitress. It is so hard to get regular maids
that the boarding-houses are all clamoring for
college girls to help them out. So we may
consider that as settled too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there won&rsquo;t be nearly enough even
then,&rdquo; said Betty, consulting the account that
Rachel had made out for her. &ldquo;Rachel
knows just how much is paid for that sort of
work, and about how much tutoring Dora can
safely depend upon, and&mdash;oh, there&rsquo;s your
money that she didn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eleanor named the sum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even with that added, there&rsquo;s not
enough. Rachel said she ought to have at
least a hundred more, that was absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>safe and sure. It&rsquo;s dreadful how much it costs
just to live!&rdquo; said Betty sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how about the Harding Aid
Society?&rdquo; asked Eleanor. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they
help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. &ldquo;I told Mary
Brooks that a sophomore I knew needed help,
and she said they had already had calls for
more money than they can possibly raise this
year. If only that old barn had burned
sooner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Eleanor spoke
hesitatingly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
my affair&mdash;but didn&rsquo;t you say that your new
society&mdash;&lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo;&mdash;was going to
give an entertainment for the Harding Aid.
Why not do it for Dora instead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty gave a little cry of delight. &ldquo;What a
fine idea! I was a stupid not to think of it
myself. I&rsquo;ll go straight back and tell Mary.
Eleanor, you&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With her hand on the door she remembered
something and turned back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll help,
of course, Eleanor. We shan&rsquo;t forget that it
was your idea, and we&rsquo;ll carry it out just as you
want us to.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>But Eleanor shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;it was &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; idea. I
only amended it a little, and I could never
carry it out. Please tell them that I donate
the amendment to them gladly, if they like it.
Run along, Betty dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Betty, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, ran
along. Mary approved of course, and at a
brief business meeting of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts,&rdquo;
held just before ten, it was formally decided
to carry out Eleanor&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we must do it soon,&rdquo; said Babe.
&ldquo;She ought to go right home if she&rsquo;s got to
go at all, so she can begin teaching in that
school. If she waits, she might lose the
chance. Fancy teaching a district school all
your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn your fancy to something more useful,&rdquo;
advised Bob. &ldquo;What kind of a show
shall we have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something Japanese,&rdquo; answered Roberta
promptly. She was the only one of the clan
who read the newspapers. &ldquo;Every one is interested
in Japan now, and it will be new
here, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; approved this sug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>gestion,
and as the lights were going out in
the halls, Mary summarily appointed Roberta
costume and decoration committee, Madeline,
Katherine and the B&rsquo;s committee on &ldquo;stunts,&rdquo;
Helen and Nita committee on general arrangements,
and Betty and Rachel committee to
see the matron about using the parlors, and
the registrar about permission to give the entertainment
and a date for holding it. Then
the meeting adjourned at a run, for the Belden
House matron had taken a sudden fancy for
walking through the upper halls on the stroke
of ten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The matron gave her consent at once. The
registrar hesitated a little, but when she found
that &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; could get on with
only four days for preparation, and when she
had read the list of members, all of whom but
Betty and Babe were among Harding&rsquo;s very
best students, she, too, consented, and furthermore
bought ten ten-cent admission tickets,
paying for them with a bill that made Betty
fairly dance with delight.</p>

<p>Everything else went on in the same pleasant
fashion. The costume committee was flooded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>with offers of real Japanese kimonos and a
bewildering collection of fans, screens, silk
scarfs, pottery, and china for decorating. Two
days before the fête, Madeline had a letter
from her father, in which he spoke of a bewitching
little Japanese lady, herself an artist,
who was sitting as model for a friend of his.
Madeline consulted the rest of her committee
and sent off a long telegram (charges collect),
asking for the loan of the Japanese lady for
the afternoon of the tea. The answer was
favorable, and the committee on arrangements
missed their luncheon in order to
make an entirely new set of posters. From
that moment the success of the tea was assured.</p>

<p>But if the Japanese lady&rsquo;s tea-making and
flower arranging were the drawing cards, there
were plenty of other attractions. Admission
tickets gave the guests entry to the house parlors,
where the Japanese lady and four excellent
American imitations, arrayed in genuine
kimonos, dispensed tea and wafers, and
made themselves as entertaining as possible
while they described the surpassing charms
of the &ldquo;side-shows&rdquo; to be found further down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>the hall. The three girls who had rooms on
the ground floor had generously contributed
the use of their quarters. In one a Japanese
soothsayer told fortunes in delicious broken
English. In another a worker of magic made
flowers grow, and produced strange sleight-of-hand
effects with swords, coins and little paper
balloons. But decidedly the star performance
of the afternoon was the third &ldquo;side-show,&rdquo;
a Japanese one-act play. This was
Madeline&rsquo;s idea. The rest of the &ldquo;stunt&rdquo;
committee had been very doubtful about the
wisdom of attempting it, and they were
amazed and delighted when it proved to be
the success of the afternoon. To begin with,
Madeline had aroused their doubts by being
so mysterious about the play. When Babe
asked where she got it and what it was about,
she answered that she &ldquo;had it,&rdquo; and that it
was like a good many other plays,&mdash;about
nothing in particular. She was definite, however,
about one thing. There were two characters,
and she would play one and Roberta
the other. When Roberta flatly refused to
take part, Madeline reminded her that she
had not yet &ldquo;paid up&rdquo; for the loan of Georgia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Ames, and calmly appointed an hour for the
first rehearsal.</p>

<p class="bgap">&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t looked at our parts,&rdquo;
Roberta protested. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to learn
them either. You must give up the play,
Madeline; it&rsquo;s impossible to have it on such
short notice.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img id="Illo2" src="images/i_114.jpg" width="400" alt="IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT ENGLISH" title=""  /></div>

<p class="center caption">IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT ENGLISH</p>

<p class="gap">&ldquo;Come over this afternoon, and if you can&rsquo;t
learn your part perfectly in ten minutes we&rsquo;ll
give it up,&rdquo; Madeline promised, and the committee,
knowing that Roberta learned slowly,
supposed that would be the end of the matter.
But after the first rehearsal Roberta was as
enthusiastic as Madeline, and the rest of the
committee, sure that their combined tastes
might be trusted, neither interfered nor asked
troublesome questions.</p>

<p>The first audience of the afternoon was surprised
and somewhat bewildered to find that
the play was not only Japanese in setting,
but was also written in Japanese. At least it
certainly was not English that the two actors
were speaking. There was a great deal of
bowing and fanning and tea-drinking, a very
expressive pantomime, and a fascinating stage-setting.
But what particularly interested the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>audience was the remarkable linguistic ability
displayed by the two actors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew Madeline Ayres could talk Choctaw
and Arabic and everything else under the
sun,&rdquo; said Christy Mason, as she passed out.
&ldquo;But Roberta Lewis doesn&rsquo;t go in for languages.
She&rsquo;s rather poor in French, and she
hasn&rsquo;t had any German since she entered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Japanese is easy,&rdquo; suggested some
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Christy decidedly. &ldquo;All
those Oriental languages are awfully hard. I
have a cousin who is attached to the legation
at&mdash;well, I forget just where he is, but it&rsquo;s
somewhere in Japan, and he told me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, please,&rdquo; called the doorkeeper.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a crowd outside waiting to come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christy Mason opened her purse and handed
the ticket-taker a second admission fee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to stay and see it again,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;Perhaps I can pick up an expression or two.
My cousin has leave at Christmas, and it
would be such fun to spring them on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the second performance
Christy started to rejoin her friends in a
state of great excitement. She stopped by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>the end of the stage to tell her strange news
to an incoming party. &ldquo;Be sure to stay for
two performances,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;They give
two entirely different plays. It&rsquo;s perfectly
wonderful. Isn&rsquo;t it, Professor Jones?&rdquo; She
appealed to the botany professor who was also
waiting to pass out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very wonderful indeed,&rdquo; agreed Professor
Jones. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose there was a girl in
college who could speak Japanese with such
ease and fluency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were standing close by the screens
which hid the stage and the actors. At the
conclusion of Professor Jones&rsquo;s remark there
came from behind the scenes a chuckle, followed
an instant later by Roberta&rsquo;s characteristic
and unmistakable titter. Christy looked
hard at the screens, frowned, pulled out her
purse and cheerfully paid a third admission.
&ldquo;I want to see if they do more than two
plays,&rdquo; she explained, choosing a seat in the
exact middle of the front row.</p>

<p>The third play was not the same as the
first, though it was quite like it. Christy
listened attentively. She heard some of the
phrases that she remembered, but they did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>not come in at the same places. At the close
of the performance she slipped in between the
screens and caught the performers laughing
wildly in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found you out,&rdquo; she announced
blandly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stayed through three of these
one-act Japanese plays of yours, and you&rsquo;re
impostors. You don&rsquo;t know two words of
Japanese between you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken, Christy,&rdquo; said Madeline.
&ldquo;We know at least a dozen that our little
Japanese friend taught us, though I won&rsquo;t
vouch for our pronunciation. Wasn&rsquo;t Professor
Jones lovely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Christy briefly, &ldquo;but tell me,
how do you ever manage it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; returned Madeline.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the Chinese theatre a lot and
that helped, because most people don&rsquo;t know
that the two languages are as the poles apart.
Then we&rsquo;ve both seen &lsquo;The Darling of the
Gods,&rsquo; and Roberta is fine at inventing gibberish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And at getting it off with a sober face,&rdquo;
added Christy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I allowed her to take part in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>my one-act Japanese play&mdash;or series of plays,
I should say. It gets too monotonous, doing
nonsense over and over in the same way, so
we change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And get caught,&rdquo; finished Christy, making
ready to depart. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t tell. I&rsquo;m going
to try to make Professor Eaton come in
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Professor Eaton, though he had cheerfully
bought tickets galore for the tea, did not
patronize it in person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter though,&rdquo; said Madeline.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got Georgia, and she&rsquo;s going to be a
handful when she gets started.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Japanese tea was not only a social
triumph, but it also scored a great financial
success. &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; had decided
beforehand that any surplus beyond the
hundred dollars needed for Dora should be
turned over to the general fund of the Harding
Aid Society; and though they had not
hoped for any such surplus, the secretary who
was summarily appointed treasurer when the
need for one arose, was able to make out a
generous check in favor of the Aid Society.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>The next question was how most tactfully to
give the rest of the money to Dora. After
some discussion it had been decided not to tell
her about the object of the tea, lest she be
made uncomfortable or be disappointed over
its possible failure. So the posters had explained
that it was &ldquo;for a good cause connected
with the Harding Aid,&rdquo; and no one but &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts,&rdquo; Eleanor, the Belden House
matron and Miss Stuart knew any more than
that. As Madeline put it, when an entertainment
is good enough so that you really want
to go, you don&rsquo;t bother much about the good
cause. The Japanese tea had been decidedly of
this popular character, and &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; were not troubled with questions.
As for Dora, Betty told her that she had consulted
Rachel and was making plans, which
she would explain about in a few days.
Meanwhile she advised Dora to write her
father how matters stood, and get his permission
to stay if the finances could be provided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no trouble about his permission,&rdquo;
Dora had said eagerly. &ldquo;He appreciates
the value of an education because he hasn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>any. Isn&rsquo;t it queer how we always appreciate
the things we haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Betty had warned her that of course
&ldquo;the plans&rdquo; might not come out as they both
hoped, and had spent the week dodging Dora,
whose anxious, eager little face was so pathetic
when you could not answer the question it put
to you.</p>

<p>But now it was settled beyond a doubt
that Dora Carlson could have her sophomore
year at Harding. The minute the proceeds
of the tea had been counted, Betty flew
to the telephone and told Mrs. Tait the good
news, promising that Dora should have the
details the next morning. Then the club
considered how to present their gift, so that it
should be most welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could just give the money to the Aid
Society, and let them tell her what they chose
about it,&rdquo; suggested Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;That method lets
Madeline out of writing the note to Miss
Carlson. She doesn&rsquo;t write any reports as it
is, and we can&rsquo;t have a secretary just for ornament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; added Mary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>&ldquo;The Aid Society would have to let her
know it was a special gift, otherwise girls who
applied for help earlier than she would feel
that they were being unfairly treated. So
there we are again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does any one think she mightn&rsquo;t
like to take the money from us?&rdquo; asked
Babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just because girls in her position are
likely to be very sensitive,&rdquo; explained Mary.
&ldquo;And most of us are almost strangers to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why not try to be friends?&rdquo; demanded
Helen Adams quickly. &ldquo;Why not
ask her to be a &lsquo;Merry Heart&rsquo;? She&rsquo;ll be too
busy to meet with us very often, but I think
it would please her and show her that we
really like her and aren&rsquo;t just giving her the
money because we are sorry for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s certainly the merriest-hearted
person I ever saw,&rdquo; added Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>The B&rsquo;s exchanged glances and then Babbie
spoke for the three. &ldquo;If it would please her,
let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Madeline wrote the note, and Betty delivered
it just after chapel the next morning,
while the rest of the club lingered ostenta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tiously
in corners of the hall to watch its reception.
This was all that could have been
desired, and &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; never regretted
their action. Dora was even busier
than Rachel and could very seldom come to
the gay evening gatherings, but she wore her
pin, a Christmas present from Bob, as proudly
as if it had been a Victoria cross; and, next to
her friendship with Eleanor, the dearest
memory she took away with her from Harding
was her membership in &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<small><small>DR. EATON FINDS HIMSELF MISTAKEN</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were only five seniors at the Belden,&mdash;a
state of affairs by no means without its compensations
for the juniors who lived in the
same house. There are decided advantages,
connected with second helpings of ice cream
and the possibility of having hot toast for
breakfast, enjoyed by the girl who sits at the
head of a table at meal times. This is ordinarily
a senior privilege, but Mary Brooks
was disqualified because she was never by any
chance on time to serve breakfast, and another
of the five spent all her Sundays with friends
in town, and so was too irregular at meals to
take her turn. One can easily get too much
of even a good thing, and the other three, not
caring for the continuous responsibility of
being &ldquo;heads,&rdquo; gave up their places every second
month to the juniors, who crowed over
their classmates in other houses where seniors
were more numerous or more tenacious of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>their rights. And this was not all. If the
matron or the house-teacher wanted to entertain
the senior contingent, it was often easier
to ask with them the juniors in the house than
to select a few seniors from outside to make up
a party of the right dimensions.</p>

<p>So the Belden House juniors were not at all
surprised and very much pleased to find that
Mrs. Kent and Miss Andrews had decided to
ask them to the annual house faculty-party, to
which usually only the seniors were invited.
Roberta Lewis, to be sure, being shy by nature
and new to campus life, declared that she could
not and would not go, and laid elaborate plans
for having a headache or a sprained ankle.
But even Roberta put aside her fears and resolved
to venture down with Mary, when it was
announced that the ice cream was to be chocolate
parfait, and that the blasé Dr. Eaton had
overpowered every one by sending an acceptance,&mdash;instead
of his usual stereotyped regrets,&mdash;to
the Belden House faculty-party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he&rsquo;ll say anything about
Georgia?&rdquo; asked Roberta eagerly, as she helped
Mary to dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>absently, patting a refractory lock of hair into
place, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t much care what he talks
about, so long as he talks to me. You juniors
needn&rsquo;t think you can monopolize him just
because you take his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always monopolize Dr. Hinsdale,&rdquo; retorted
Madeline, who was waiting, so she said,
to go down-stairs under Mary&rsquo;s protecting
wing. &ldquo;At the last Dramatic Club reception
he didn&rsquo;t so much as speak to any one
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, neither did I, for that matter,&rdquo; said
Mary thoughtfully, &ldquo;so why don&rsquo;t you say he
monopolized me? It sounds very much better.&rdquo;
She gave a final glance into the mirror.
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t let Dr. Eaton monopolize me,&rdquo; she
added as she went out, &ldquo;but I shan&rsquo;t let him
monopolize any one else either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary was a great favorite with most of the
faculty, for the simple reason that she stood
not at all in awe of them, but chattered on to
the learned Miss Ferris or the dignified
Professor Lawrence just as spontaneously as if
they had been Harvard freshmen or members
of the clan. Mrs. Kent was a great admirer
of Mary&rsquo;s social gifts, and knowing that her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>supply of small talk never failed her, she
seized upon her the minute she appeared and
turned her over to the new German professor,
who was stranded in a corner, looking sadly
at the gay groups around him and wishing
himself and his scant knowledge of English
safe back in the Fatherland. Mary put him
at his ease immediately, for her German was
a trifle worse than his English; and in trying
to set her right and supply the words she
could not remember he forgot his own mistakes.
He was soon cozily ensconced in a
nook under the stairs, eating chocolate parfait
and trying to understand why he must not ask
a young lady&rsquo;s permission &ldquo;to hold her a few
moments after the class.&rdquo; Mary, for her part,
was so absorbed in her efforts to explain the
subtle difference between hold and keep that
she had entirely forgotten Dr. Eaton, and she
and her escort were probably the only persons
in the room who did not stop talking to stare
at him when he came in. Mrs. Kent looked
anxiously around for Mary to take this distressingly
haughty young man off her hands,
but the stairs screened her and her German,
and Mrs. Kent flew to Betty Wales, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>having a beautiful time talking to her beloved
Miss Ferris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and amuse the
melancholy Dane. You girls all seemed to be
delighted because he was coming, but for my
part I can&rsquo;t see why. I&rsquo;ll take care of Miss
Ferris, but I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t talk to him any
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Betty rose obediently and was duly presented
to Dr. Eaton, who to her astonishment
came immediately out of his melancholy and
received the introduction with evident pleasure.
He smiled his rare smile as he shook
hands, and when Betty asked him if he wanted
an ice he seized two from a passing waitress in
a summary fashion that bespoke much experience
with afternoon teas. It couldn&rsquo;t be that
he was a woman-hater, Betty decided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could find you a seat,&rdquo; he said,
glancing down the long hall. &ldquo;Ah, I have
it! Is that little room off there forbidden
territory?&rdquo; As the little room was Mrs.
Kent&rsquo;s parlor, which was always opened for
house teas, Betty led the way there and sat
down, wondering why in the world Dr. Eaton
had &ldquo;wanted to meet her for a long time,&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>what in the world they should find to talk
about.</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton settled the second question easily
enough. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, drawing a chair
nearer to the one that Betty had chosen, &ldquo;has
your mother gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Betty in amazement, &ldquo;she
went to-day.&rdquo; (Mrs. Wales and the smallest
sister had started that morning for Chicago.)
&ldquo;But how, please, did you know anything
about my mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a note from her,&rdquo; answered Dr.
Eaton calmly, &ldquo;so I knew that she had been
here; and as it was some little time ago, I
naturally concluded that she might have left.
It really wasn&rsquo;t difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty stared at him in utter bewilderment
and blushing confusion. Her mother had
never been to Harding. And what could she
have written about to Dr. Eaton? Ever since
her father&rsquo;s famous telegram to the registrar
at the beginning of her freshman year, Betty
had lived in dread of some similar breach of
college etiquette on the part of her parents.
Now it had come. Her mother had probably
asked Dr. Eaton to give shorter lessons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>She faced the issue boldly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
that mother had written you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What did she want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks that ten-minute tests are spoiling
your constitution,&rdquo; answered Dr. Eaton
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s chagrin was comical.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly like her. Isn&rsquo;t it queer
that mothers and fathers can&rsquo;t understand
that a college is different from a boarding-school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very queer,&rdquo; agreed Dr. Eaton, smiling
again. &ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t put her up to writing
the letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Betty indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew you didn&rsquo;t do it on your own
account,&rdquo; Dr. Eaton assured her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy
to see that ten-minute tests don&rsquo;t bother you;
but I thought you might have been working
for your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty looked hard at Dr. Eaton to see if he
was laughing at her. &ldquo;What do you mean
by saying that writing isn&rsquo;t hard for me?&rdquo;
she demanded at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard indeed,
and I do it very badly. I know, for
you&rsquo;ve told me so on almost every paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you so on almost every paper?&rdquo;
repeated Dr. Eaton uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>All at once an explanation of their conversation
at cross-purposes flashed across Betty.
&ldquo;Dr. Eaton,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must have confused
me with some one else. Who do you
think I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Miss Georgia Ames,&rdquo; announced
Dr. Eaton with calm conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; gasped Betty, and then,
as the absurdity of the situation struck her,
she was overcome by laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said, when she
could speak, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t imagine how
funny it is that I should be taken for Georgia
Ames. If you only knew me, and&mdash;and&mdash;Georgia,
you&rsquo;d appreciate the joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely I should,&rdquo; assented Professor
Eaton genially. &ldquo;As it is, I&rsquo;m very much
puzzled. In class I have always supposed
that you were Miss Ames, and just now, when
Mrs. Kent introduced me, I was sure she said
Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wales and Ames do sound a little alike,&rdquo;
admitted Betty, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s the only similarity
between us.&rdquo; Then she laughed again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>too bad that you can&rsquo;t meet Georgia, when
you&rsquo;ve wanted to so long. But she doesn&rsquo;t
live in this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Dr. Eaton absently. &ldquo;But
what puzzles me is to think who she can be,&mdash;if
she really isn&rsquo;t you. What does she look
like, Miss Wales?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty hesitated. &ldquo;Why, she&mdash;she&rsquo;s very
good-looking,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;fine-looking,
I mean, and she&mdash;she dresses very well indeed.
She always carries handkerchiefs with
real lace on them,&rdquo; finished Betty swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That just reminds me,&rdquo; remarked Dr.
Eaton, setting his ice cream plate on the table
with a thud. &ldquo;I have a handkerchief that
belongs to her in one of my pockets this minute.
It had lace on it, too. She dropped it
one day in my classroom and I picked it up
to give to the janitor and then forgot all about
it. I mustn&rsquo;t fail to return it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; advised Betty, trying hard to keep
sober. &ldquo;She might want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me much about her
looks,&rdquo; pursued Dr. Eaton. &ldquo;Is she tall or
short?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;why, she&rsquo;s medium, I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>think,&rdquo; invented Betty hastily. &ldquo;Really, Dr.
Eaton, I never noticed her particularly.&rdquo;
Just then Betty&rsquo;s eyes fell on Roberta, who was
standing alone near the door of Mrs. Kent&rsquo;s
room. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; she commanded,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll get Roberta Lewis. She knows
Georgia pretty well, and she&rsquo;s very good at
description. I know I&rsquo;m particularly bad at
it, for you&rsquo;ve said so repeatedly yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberta was overwhelmed by the idea of
having to talk to Dr. Eaton, but she came in
perforce, and stayed long enough to describe
Georgia in detail and with considerable picturesqueness.</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton listened intently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t place Miss Ames at all&mdash;but
then my classes are very large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she an especially interesting girl?&rdquo;
asked Betty, squeezing Roberta&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She writes extremely well,&rdquo; answered Dr.
Eaton stiffly, and the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Betty explained, telling the
story to &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; that evening,
&ldquo;he realized all of a sudden that he oughtn&rsquo;t
to be discussing her so frankly with us. Of
course he shouldn&rsquo;t, if she was a real person.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he suspects anything?&rdquo;
asked Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; declared Betty. &ldquo;He was
just as serious as could be, wasn&rsquo;t he,
Roberta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny to me that the girls don&rsquo;t any
of them see through her,&rdquo; said Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therein,&rdquo; declared Madeline proudly,
&ldquo;lies the merit of the idea. Second selves
are not common enough to be suspected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; put in Betty, &ldquo;that Dr.
Eaton will remember whose mother it was that
wrote the foolish letter. Helen&rsquo;s &lsquo;touch&rsquo;
seems to have impressed him more than anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;that
several of you are neglecting your duties to
Georgia? Betty, you haven&rsquo;t done anything
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; exclaimed Betty in great indignation.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I have to impersonate
her for at least ten minutes, and then endure
Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s disappointment when he found
that I wasn&rsquo;t Georgia after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mary was her first victim,&rdquo; said
Katherine, &ldquo;if you count that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; Madeline assured her,
smiling engagingly at the president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about you, Rachel?&rdquo; went on Katherine.
&ldquo;Have you contributed anything to
the spreading of Georgia&rsquo;s fame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have,&rdquo; declared Rachel. &ldquo;I sent
her an invitation to Clio Club&rsquo;s open meeting,
when I wanted it dreadfully for some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she sent you a note of thanks, and attended
the meeting in the person of her better
half,&rdquo; said Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am the only delinquent,&rdquo; sighed
Katherine, &ldquo;and I promised to do something
startling before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her opportunity came that very evening.
On her way home to the Westcott she met little
Alice Waite, in great distress because she
had two men on her hands for the Glee Club
Concert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked one of them away back last summer,&rdquo;
Alice explained, &ldquo;and he was coming,
but last week he found that he couldn&rsquo;t, so I
asked the other. To-day the first one telegraphed
that he should be here after all, and
the second one wrote that he should be delighted
to come. It&rsquo;s dreadfully stupid, e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ntertaining
two men who are strangers to each
other, and it&rsquo;s so late that all the girls I know
have men of their own. Have you one,
K.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Katherine, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to say
that I haven&rsquo;t. Men frighten me to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do take one of mine,&rdquo; begged Alice.</p>

<p>Katherine was obdurate. &ldquo;I love you, gentle
Alice, but not to that extent,&rdquo; she said.
Then she had a sudden inspiration, and recklessly
she made use of it. &ldquo;But I know a
girl who&rsquo;ll take your extra man,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a freshman, but she&rsquo;s awfully clever
and amusing. Her name is Georgia Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard of her,&rdquo; cried Alice eagerly.
&ldquo;I was over at the Westcott the night some
lovely violets were sent there for her by mistake.
She must be awfully popular. How do
you know she hasn&rsquo;t a man of her own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I do,&rdquo; said Katherine sturdily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know her,&rdquo; objected Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do. I&rsquo;ll explain and I promise
you that it will be all right. If Georgia
takes your man he&rsquo;ll have the time of his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t care which man she
had?&rdquo; asked Alice anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed she will care,&rdquo; teased Katherine.
&ldquo;She will prefer the one you don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all settled,&rdquo; cried Alice. &ldquo;You
see it is dreadfully awkward because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Katherine cut her short. &ldquo;There
was a little quarrel, but now it&rsquo;s made up,
and Man Number Two is very much in the
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice blushed and laughed, but did not
deny it. &ldquo;You must take me to call on Miss
Ames,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But first please explain
what I want, and be sure to tell her that I
have splendid seats for her. I shall write
Tom to-night that he&rsquo;s going with a regular
belle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say anything you like about her,&rdquo; encouraged
Katherine. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t exaggerate
when you&rsquo;re praising Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day she sought out Rachel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
a fix,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve boosted Georgia
too hard. All the rest of you tell your little
tales and then find a hole to crawl out of.
But as far as I can see, I&rsquo;ve got to produce
my Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Rachel, when she had heard
the whole story. &ldquo;Have her send Alice a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>note to say that she has been called away
from college for the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And take the man myself?&rdquo; asked Katherine.
&ldquo;Not by any means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rachel considered. &ldquo;Of course it would
be against the rules of the game to leave
Alice in the lurch, but perhaps Betty will
take him. I heard her say that her concert
man had broken his collar-bone and couldn&rsquo;t
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Georgia wrote Alice that she had been
having bad headaches, for which her doctor
prescribed a week of rest on a farm outside
Harding. She was extremely sorry to miss
the concert, but her dear friend Betty Wales
had promised to help Alice out in her stead.</p>

<p>Alice hurried straight over to Betty to say
how glad she was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d a lot rather have
you take Tom,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I was worried
about Miss Ames. Lots of people seem to
know about her, but no one really knows her
except you and Katherine. I think she must
be just a little queer, and Tom hates queerness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she is a little bit queer,&rdquo; admitted
Betty, trying hard not to laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Alice puckered
her smooth forehead as she tried to settle
it. &ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; she ventured at last, &ldquo;now tell
me honestly, do you mind if I slur over your
name and let Tom Alison think it&rsquo;s Ames, if
he wants to? You see I had to explain that
I wasn&rsquo;t going to take him to the concert
myself, and it was a little awkward; so I told
him what a fine girl he was going with,&mdash;how
pretty and popular she was, and all that. It
just fits you, Betty, and it does seem as if I
couldn&rsquo;t write it all over and think of new
things to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Alice,&rdquo; laughed Betty, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too absurd.
You see&mdash;oh, if you knew Georgia
you wouldn&rsquo;t suggest such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean she is the kind that wouldn&rsquo;t
like it?&rdquo; asked Alice anxiously. &ldquo;But
couldn&rsquo;t you explain it to her, Betty? Tell
her how busy I am, and how I hate to write
notes, and how I praised her to Tom until I
haven&rsquo;t any adjectives left. Couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty considered, still laughing with a
heartiness that puzzled Alice. &ldquo;Why, perhaps
I could,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Georgia is
awfully good-natured. I think she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>understand, and of course my feelings don&rsquo;t
count at all, so long as Mr. Alison has some
one to take him to the concert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day, after consulting the rest of &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts,&rdquo; Betty told Alice that Georgia
understood, and so it happened that Tom
Alison went back to Yale the day after the
concert singing the praises of Miss Georgia
Ames to all who would listen to his rapturous
eulogies. Inquiries about her came back
to Harding from brothers, cousins and friends
at Yale. Also Mr. Tom Alison sent a box of
Huyler&rsquo;s to Miss Ames at the Belden, accompanying
it with an invitation to the Yale
prom.</p>

<p>Betty took the note and the candy over to
Alice. &ldquo;See what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; she said,
with a face that was sober, all but the eyes.
&ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t keep them. They belong
to the real Georgia&mdash;the one you wrote the
note about. You must take them to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Alice in great
distress. &ldquo;She would have to acknowledge
them somehow, and that means that she
would have to explain to Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you would have to,&rdquo; said Betty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>severely. &ldquo;Well, which is worse&mdash;for you to
explain or for me to? If I answered, I should
have to tell him how it was just as much. I
know a lot of Yale men, and I can&rsquo;t go to the
prom. as Georgia Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can decline,&rdquo; suggested Alice
desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s quite fair to make me
do that?&rdquo; inquired Betty judicially. &ldquo;Of
course, when he finds out, he may not want
to take me; but I think he&rsquo;ll see the joke.
Oh, Alice, it&rsquo;s too delicious! There isn&rsquo;t any
Georgia Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; gasped Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t tell a soul, but I&rsquo;ve
got to make you understand,&mdash;she&rsquo;s only
Madeline Ayres&rsquo;s second self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeline&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; asked Alice.</p>

<p>Betty repeated. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what Madeline
calls her. She&rsquo;s a fictitious person, you
know. Madeline invented her, and we have
had lots of fun making people believe she was
real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;why&mdash;she gets letters and violets
and notes on the bulletin board,&rdquo; protested
Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she makes calls and drops handkerchiefs
and takes English Essayists,&rdquo; added
Betty, &ldquo;but you see this is how we manage
her.&rdquo; She explained the methods of &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rdquo; and the bewilderment of Dr.
Eaton. &ldquo;So this isn&rsquo;t the first time that I&rsquo;ve
been Georgia,&ldquo; she concluded. &ldquo;Now do you
think Mr. Alison will forgive me? Because
he says in his note that he&rsquo;s coming to call
next Wednesday, and I might try to explain
then, instead of writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Needless to say, Mr. Alison forgave the fair
conspirators. More than that, he was delighted
with Georgia and promised to make her fairly
famous at Yale. He had just received a composite
picture of his sister&rsquo;s crowd at school,
and he got Betty to write &ldquo;Georgia Ames&rdquo;
and the date on the back of it. The composite
Georgia was a very pretty girl, and the
slightly blurred effect was artistic and at the
same time decidedly suggestive of Georgia&rsquo;s
elusive personality. Mr. Alison promised to
send for more copies of Georgia&rsquo;s picture for
distribution among &ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was all the more interested because it
seemed that Dr. Eaton was a friend of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>older brother William, and Tom insisted upon
having all the details of Georgia&rsquo;s career in
&ldquo;English Essayists&rdquo; in order that he might
write to William, who was surveying a railroad
route in Arizona, all about the joke on
his old chum.</p>

<p>Betty had not been particularly interested
in Georgia until the day of the faculty tea.
Her interview with Dr. Eaton then and the
subsequent adventure with Alice and Tom
Alison aroused her imagination, and she entered
into the plans for Georgia&rsquo;s future as
eagerly as Mary or Roberta. Even now, however,
Mary accused her of being interested, not
in Georgia, but in Dr. Eaton. To be sure
Mary&rsquo;s theory was largely founded on envy.
She had thoroughly enjoyed the faculty tea,
but she had not succeeded in meeting Dr.
Eaton, who had left as soon as he finished his
conversation with Betty. He had walked
home with Ethel Hale, as Betty knew, because
she had been bidding Ethel good-bye at the
door, when he came up and, saying he believed
they went the same way, asked permission
to walk along with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&mdash;it&rsquo;s not at all necessary,&ldquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>Ethel had said, &ldquo;but do as you wish.&rdquo; Dr.
Eaton had looked hurt, Betty thought, but he
went out with Ethel nevertheless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Ethel doesn&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo;
Betty reflected. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s awfully nice,
when he tries to be. And Ethel isn&rsquo;t a blue-stocking
like some of the women on the faculty.
She likes men and good times just as
well as we girls do.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<small><small>DR. EATON GROWS MAJESTIC</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> had not violated a promise in telling
Alice Waite and Tom Alison about Georgia.
The joke was really getting too good to keep,
and Madeline had suggested that, as Georgia
had not much longer to live, her friends and
promoters should let the cat out of the bag by
inches, being careful, however, to keep Dr.
Eaton in the dark until the very last minute.
So probably half the ten o&rsquo;clock class in English
Essayists had heard about Georgia, and
nudged their neighbors excitedly when, one
morning in late December, Dr. Eaton announced
that he wished to see Miss Ames for
a moment at the close of the hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts,&rdquo; most of whom were
in the ten o&rsquo;clock division, exchanged swift
glances, and then tried to conceal their amusement
or embarrassment in various characteristic
fashions. Madeline and Roberta, each wearing
an expression of lamb-like innocence, stared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>inquiringly at Dr. Eaton. Bob stuffed her
handkerchief into her mouth to keep from
laughing out loud. Helen studied her note-book
with an air of intense absorption. Babe,
Babbie and Betty played with their fountain
pens and tried vainly not to look ill at ease.
The rest of the class, however, made no particular
effort not to look interested, and Dr.
Eaton, in spite of his impersonal attitude
toward his young charges, must have detected
something unusual in the air.</p>

<p>Nobody knew how he had settled the
question of Georgia&rsquo;s identity since the day of
the Belden House tea. Either he had lost interest
in her, and had not taken the trouble to
pick her out of the class; or else he had failed
to do so and was too proud to ask any more
questions. All &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; knew
was the fact of his having finally given
Georgia&rsquo;s handkerchief to the janitor, who had
in turn surrendered it to Babe, after a long
argument in which he flatly declared that
there was &ldquo;somethin&rsquo; crooked somewhar and
he&rsquo;d hold her responsible if that there Miss
Ames ever turned up to bother him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now Dr. Eaton had requested Georgia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>to wait after class! While &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; were still frantically racking their
brains for a way of turning the situation to
account, he launched another question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Ames present this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Madeline Ayres
promptly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ill, I presume. Shall I
take the message to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will write a note,&rdquo; answered
Dr. Eaton in his most icy manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; returned Madeline cheerfully.
&ldquo;It will amount to the same thing. I
mean I will see that she gets the note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s lecture was even more brilliant
than usual, but it is doubtful if the initiated
half of the ten o&rsquo;clock division in English
Essayists knew any more about the genius of
Thomas Carlyle at its close than they had at
its commencement. The question before the
house was: What did Dr. Eaton want of
Georgia Ames, and would her sponsors be able
to save her life until after midyears, as they
had planned?</p>

<p>At the close of the hour &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
hunted up their president and gathered in an
excited group outside the library door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be late to astronomy and Jane
Ellis will get the only decent telescope to see
sun-spots with,&rdquo; announced Katherine Kittredge,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care. What in the world
do you suppose he wants of Georgia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that now,&rdquo; interposed Mary
hastily. &ldquo;The point is to get the note before
some of the girls who know the secret grab it
for their memory books. Which hour can you
watch the bulletin board, K.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve to one,&rdquo; answered Katherine
briskly, starting after her favorite telescope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Betty is going to take half of this
hour. Can you take the rest, Roberta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberta nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will cut lunch, because I am going
down-town for breakfast now, and I shan&rsquo;t
really need any more food at one. That covers
the time till two, and the rest of you can arrange
about the afternoon later. Now run for
your classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether intentionally or otherwise, Dr.
Eaton led &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; a tedious
chase. Twelve and one came and went, and
still no note appeared on the faculty bulletin
board, though Dr. Eaton was in his office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>liable to emerge at any unguarded moment.
At one he went off to lunch, but Mary kept
her tryst all the same, because he might come
back unexpectedly early. From two to three
Babbie sat disconsolately on the stairs, where
Dr. Eaton would not notice her&mdash;and where it
was too dark to read or study. At three Nita
came on duty. At three-thirty Rachel took
her place and kept it until five, because Babe
and Babbie forgot their hours and appeared
then, together with Helen Adams. Helen had
just sent the two B&rsquo;s away, because they were
so noisy that they would certainly attract attention,
when Dr. Eaton swung down the hall
straight past his office door, posted a note on
the faculty bulletin, and strode off, whistling
jovially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much nicer he seems when he thinks
nobody is around,&rdquo; Helen reflected, as, barely
waiting until he was out of sight, she seized
the note and hurried over to twenty-seven,
Belden.</p>

<p>Betty, Madeline and Mary were already
there, drinking tea and talking over Georgia&rsquo;s
predicament. Madeline demanded the privilege
of reading the note first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I was afraid of,&rdquo; she said,
glancing rapidly through it and passing it to
Mary. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t help it. The rest of
you were ready enough to make the frills for
Georgia, but you left all the plain sewing to
me, and of course I couldn&rsquo;t manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; demanded Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Georgia is held up for cutting too much,&rdquo;
explained Madeline. &ldquo;In other words she
hasn&rsquo;t handed in her ten-minute tests very
regularly. You see I omitted a few when I
thought the rest of you were doing them, and
last week and the week before I hadn&rsquo;t studied
at all, and I simply couldn&rsquo;t bluff for two.
So I did my best for Madeline Ayres and
let Georgia Ames shift for herself, poor
thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, girls. Isn&rsquo;t this lovely?&rdquo; cried
Mary, who had finished the note. &ldquo;&lsquo;I deeply
regret the necessity of asking you to explain
your many absences from English Essayists.
I need not say that your work has been unusually
satisfactory; but you know the Harding
rule about cuts, doubtless better than I.
Miss Stuart assures me that it is ironclad, and
therefore I am left no choice but to hope that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>your absences have some good excuse&mdash;and
that you have not lost interest in the course.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Most respectfully,<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">John Elliot Eaton</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fishing for a compliment, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said
Madeline scornfully. &ldquo;Well, we can give him
one, I suppose; but if Georgia is to go on one
of you must shoulder her ten-minute tests
from now to midyears. I am really too
busy to read the topics, and if I invented for
two I should certainly be caught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Madeline,&rdquo; said Roberta sadly, &ldquo;you
know perfectly well that the rest of us can&rsquo;t
do papers for two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a discouraged silence. &ldquo;How
about Rachel?&rdquo; asked Mary at last. &ldquo;She is
awfully clever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t take Essayists though,&rdquo; said
Bob, who had come in with the other B&rsquo;s in
the course of the letter-reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Roberta sadly, &ldquo;Georgia must
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; cried Betty, &ldquo;she mustn&rsquo;t die just
now, when she&rsquo;s going on so splendidly at
Yale&mdash;and before her pictures have come, too.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Could we&mdash;oh, dear!&rdquo; Then, with sudden
inspiration, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we have her leave college
instead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; cried Babbie excitedly. &ldquo;She
leaves for her health. That would explain
her cutting. She can stay out over midyears
and come back some time in the spring, when
we have more time to play with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad she hasn&rsquo;t got to miss spring
term,&rdquo; said Helen, with a little sigh. Helen
still took her pleasures very seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I write the note?&rdquo; asked Madeline,
appropriating Betty&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;And shall I
have her say what is the matter with her, or
where she is going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have her go off a good long
way,&rdquo; suggested Bob, &ldquo;or Dr. Eaton might
think of following her&mdash;if he&rsquo;s really as interested
as Betty thought he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know just what to do,&rdquo; cried Babe.
&ldquo;Have her catch pneumonia from that window
that he&rsquo;s always opening right on to me in
English Essayists. Then she could go out
west somewhere to strengthen her lungs.
Where do people go to strengthen their
lungs?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Arizona, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; answered Mary
doubtfully. &ldquo;Anyhow say Arizona, Madeline.
It sounds so nice and stunty and far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Betty made fresh tea for the late
comers, Madeline wrote her note. &ldquo;Dear Dr.
Eaton&rdquo;&mdash;it began:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;I was rather surprised to get a complaint
from you about my cuts. I do not think my
name can be in the right place on your roll,
for I have listened carefully and I never hear
it called. Some one said to-day that she
thought it was down at the very end of the
list. If so, I never noticed it and that probably
explains most of the cuts.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Madeline paused. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather lovely?
You know he hasn&rsquo;t called the roll but once
since he came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; said Mary breathlessly.
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;As for the very recent absences,&rdquo; Madeline
continued, &ldquo;I am sure you must have heard
how ill I have been. You remember the cold
Wednesday we had two weeks ago? I sat
right beside the open window in English Essayists,
and that night I came down with
pneumonia. I am much better now&mdash;quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>out of danger, the doctor says,&mdash;but he insists
on my trying a warmer climate this winter.
So I am off for Arizona to-morrow. I shall
be very sorry to leave Harding, particularly
your classes. I find the lectures anything but
dull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoping to return to my work soon, I am</p>

<p class="right2">&ldquo;Sincerely yours,&ldquo;</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Georgia Ames</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;That is great,&rdquo; declared Katherine, when
Madeline had finished.</p>

<p>Madeline laughed. &ldquo;If you think so, you
might be the one to give it to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed Katherine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hand
it to him before class to-morrow. Then after
class you can inquire whether he got it all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;and Roberta can
inquire too. Then next day Betty can linger
on the way out and ask if he doesn&rsquo;t think it
is a pity about Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall sit near the window that day,&rdquo;
put in Babbie eagerly, &ldquo;and ask him to have
it opened, if he doesn&rsquo;t open it of his own
accord. And Babe can shiver and cough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>and then we&rsquo;ll watch him slam it down hard
in memory of his dear Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton rose to the bait with almost
annoying readiness. Apparently he found
nothing strange in the remarkable solicitude
of Georgia&rsquo;s friends. He lectured patiently
in a stuffy room, or opened the window a
crack and cautioned the whole class to let
him know the instant they felt a draught.
Furthermore he rearranged his roll in exact
alphabetical order, and called it scrupulously
at the beginning of each recitation. &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rdquo; found these developments so
amusing that they regretted having packed
Georgia off in such desperate haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might just as well have let her come
to class once more, to hear one last lecture,&rdquo;
said Rachel sadly. &ldquo;It would have been risky,
but everything Georgia does is that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we do it still?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bob decidedly, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t. I
told Dr. Eaton only this morning that Georgia
had got to Arizona. He asked me where she
was going to stay, and I said that she was
going to try Tombstone for a while anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see through that,&rdquo; said Babbie scornfully.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too silly even for Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See through what?&rdquo; inquired Babe loftily.
&ldquo;I suppose you think there isn&rsquo;t any such
place as Tombstone, do you? But I looked
it up on a map, and there is, and furthermore
I&rsquo;ve got several other beautiful names ready
in case Georgia doesn&rsquo;t care for Tombstone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as soon as we get back after Christmas,
you&rsquo;d better give us her itinerary,&rdquo; advised
Mary. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to slip up on a
little thing like the geography of Arizona,
when we&rsquo;ve got her safely through everything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I was safely through my packing,&rdquo;
grumbled Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wish I was safely home,&rdquo; added
Betty. &ldquo;Just think! If it wasn&rsquo;t for that
one class of Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s to-morrow I could
start to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ve got to stay,&rdquo; suggested
Madeline, &ldquo;be sure and talk to him a little
about Georgia. We don&rsquo;t want him to forget
her during the Christmas vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; Betty promised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell him that her mother has gone out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>spend Christmas with her. He&rsquo;ll be so nice
and sympathetic and he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m glad
of that. Fancy spending your Christmas
alone in a place called Tombstone!&rsquo; I love
to hear him say &lsquo;fancy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Betty arrived at the
station hot and breathless, barely in time for
the eleven-thirty train to the junction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save me a seat, Madeline,&rdquo; she panted,
&ldquo;with you and Mary and Roberta. I&rsquo;ve got
something to tell you; but first I&rsquo;ve got to
check my trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think Dr. Eaton did?&rdquo;
she began indignantly when she was finally
seated beside her three friends, with the B&rsquo;s
and Nita just across the aisle. &ldquo;I told him
that Mrs. Erasmus J.&mdash;of course I didn&rsquo;t call
her that&mdash;had gone out to Tombstone, and he
was positively frigid. He just said, &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
and went on looking out the window. I was
bound to make him take an interest, so I told
him that she was dreadfully worried about
Georgia, and he only said &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; again.
Then I happened to remember that I had her
picture with me. Tom sent them to-day, and
I was carrying Mary&rsquo;s to her. So I said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>&lsquo;Dr. Eaton, you asked me once how Georgia
looked. I&rsquo;ve just got her picture. Should
you like to see it?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
trouble, Miss Wales. I hope you will have
a delightful vacation.&rsquo; Now what do you
make of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plain as day,&rdquo; said Mary calmly. &ldquo;Some
disagreeable person has told him that Georgia
is a fake, and he&rsquo;s naturally huffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody would do that,&rdquo; protested
Roberta. &ldquo;Every one who knows about
Georgia knows that Dr. Eaton is the particular
victim who isn&rsquo;t to be told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps some stupid let it out by mistake,&rdquo;
suggested Madeline, &ldquo;or may be some
of the faculty got hold of it and didn&rsquo;t approve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I should think he&rsquo;d be a little amused,&rdquo;
said Betty sadly, &ldquo;and he didn&rsquo;t show the least
little speck of amusement. Of course I suppose
he has a right to be annoyed at our
freshness. We have been awfully fresh, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it was that,&rdquo; objected Nita, who had
come to sit on the arm of Betty&rsquo;s seat, &ldquo;I
should think he&rsquo;d have shown his feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>long ago. He&rsquo;s been so amiable about Georgia&mdash;so
much more amiable than he has about
anything else&mdash;that I thought he&rsquo;d suspected
all along that she was a fake, and that he
liked the joke as well as we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty stared disconsolately out the window.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a pity that Georgia should be
spoiled just at the end,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish I
had asked him right out what the matter
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might go back and do it now,&rdquo; suggested
Mary. &ldquo;He is probably still sitting
there thinking about Georgia, and it may spoil
his whole vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty shrugged her shoulders and turned
back from the dismal prospect with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you may laugh all you
like, but I am sorry. I like Dr. Eaton, if
Madeline doesn&rsquo;t, and I hate to have a misunderstanding
about Georgia.&rdquo; But Betty was
never disconsolate for long. &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she called
across the aisle a few moments later, &ldquo;is
Georgia liking Tombstone so far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob nodded. &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t Georgia&rsquo;s photographer
a perfect wonder? I got her picture
this morning. Want to see it?&rdquo; she asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>turning to the round-eyed freshman in the
next seat. &ldquo;You know we all think that
Georgia Ames is about the most interesting
girl in your class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The freshman stared at Georgia&rsquo;s picture in
awe-struck silence, privately resolving to look
up Miss Ames the minute she got back. For
if she was admired like that by &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts,&rdquo; she must indeed be a marvel.</p>

<small><small>THE UNDOING OF GEORGIA</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Christmas vacations are alike. Just as
you are beginning to realize that Christmas is
really coming, and that it is almost time to
pack to go home, the faculty make a
unanimous decision to give papers or written
lessons to all their classes. This seems to be
their idea of making the holiday pleasant, by
making the week before the holidays particularly
full of agonies. And no matter what
courses you are taking, the written lesson in the
one you know least about is sure to come
on the last day of the term. When it is over,
you rush back to your room, tuck the Christmas
packages that you have strict injunctions
not to open until the right day comes into
your trunk, shut the lid&mdash;with the assistance
of several friends&mdash;sweep the débris that
litters your dresser into a suit case, and run
for your train. Probably you think you
have failed in your test, but you have no
time to worry about that now. You are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>going home for Christmas! If you are lucky
enough to live on one of the main-traveled
roads you will have plenty of company on the
journey, and you will slip from your friends&rsquo;
clamorous good-byes straight into the waiting
arms of your family. And before you have
settled down to the joyful fact that you are at
home, Christmas is over, everything you
wanted most is packed in your trunk&mdash;but
with mother&rsquo;s packing there is somehow
room enough&mdash;and you are speeding back to
college. Glad? Yes&mdash;and sorry. But how
much sorrier you would be if the rest were
going back without you.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s Christmas was &ldquo;just perfectly lovely&rdquo;&mdash;so
she told her father, who always sympathized
with Betty&rsquo;s raptures. It brought her
the furs she had wanted, and the Temple
Shakespeares, and the snow-shoes, and a copper
chafing-dish as nearly like Babbie&rsquo;s as Will
had been able to buy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you extravagant boy!&rdquo; cried Betty
when she saw it. &ldquo;When I have a perfectly
good nickel one now. But things will taste
twice as good in this! Let&rsquo;s make a rabbit
this minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>And they did&mdash;at ten o&rsquo;clock on Christmas
morning, and the Wales family unanimously
declared that they had never tasted such a
rabbit before, and unanimously laid the credit
at the door of Harding College, which had
taught them all that the most impossible
things are often the most amusing.</p>

<p>One thing that made this Christmas vacation
seem particularly precious was because
father and mother would not be at home for
the Easter one. Betty&rsquo;s father had overworked,
so the doctor said, and must take a
long, restful vacation. So he and Mrs. Wales
were going to spend the remainder of the
winter in the West Indies. They had not decided
just when or where they would go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attend to all that when we get rid
of you, young lady,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales, playfully
pinching Betty&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t those look interesting?&rdquo;
He pointed to a great pile of
steamship and railway folders on the library
table. &ldquo;And if you weren&rsquo;t in college we&rsquo;d
take you along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Betty. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
believe you would. You and mother are such
old lovers You&rsquo;d rather go alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to go alone,&rdquo; corrected her father
laughingly. &ldquo;Will has his business to attend
to, and Nan has to stay and look after Will,
and Little Sister has to stay and look after
Nan. Don&rsquo;t you, Little Sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smallest sister nodded solemnly. &ldquo;Nan
would be awful lonesome if I wented wif you,&rdquo;
she explained with an air of great importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if Betty wasn&rsquo;t in college we&rsquo;d take
her,&rdquo; went on Mr. Wales, &ldquo;and she could pick
oranges and grape-fruits, and sit under spreading
palm-trees, and shin up the trunks for
cocoanuts, and pick roses in January and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged Betty. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!
It sounds just too lovely for anything. Promise
to take me the first winter after I&rsquo;m through
college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; teased her
father. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take a vacation every winter,
you know. The last one I had was&mdash;let me see&mdash;twenty
years ago, Miss Betty. So you may
have to wait twenty years more if you don&rsquo;t
seize your chance and go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Betty severely, &ldquo;you know
you wouldn&rsquo;t think much of me if I should
give up college in my junior year&mdash;even to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>pick you roses and oranges in the West
Indies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m
glad that all my children are the sort that
stick to whatever they undertake. It pays in
the end&mdash;and perhaps I can manage another
vacation in&mdash;say ten years, Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Betty demurely, planting
a kiss on his forehead and running off to
see if Will was ready to go skating with the
merry crowd of boys and girls who were just
turning in at the front gate.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these Christmas excitements
it is small wonder that Betty forgot
Georgia. She entertained the family at breakfast
one morning with an account of her lively
adventures, and amused herself by putting
Georgia&rsquo;s picture among her Christmas gifts
and listening to the varied comments of her
Cleveland friends, who were much attracted
by Georgia&rsquo;s appearance. The men particularly
called her &ldquo;stunning&rdquo; and &ldquo;a good
looker,&rdquo; and inquired anxiously when she was
coming to visit Betty. And Betty laughed
and promised to have her &ldquo;as soon as she
could,&rdquo; thinking what fun she would have at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Easter, laughing at them for getting so excited
over a composite photograph.</p>

<p>But Georgia was the merest episode during
the vacation, and though several of &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rdquo; went back on the same train
with Betty, the talk was all of Christmas presents
and Christmas gaieties&mdash;dances, dinners,
skating and sleighing parties&mdash;and Georgia
was not even mentioned. Tom Alison, being
a politic youth, had not allowed himself to be
forgotten during the vacation. He sent Betty
candy for Christmas and violets for New
Year&rsquo;s, and she was not at all surprised, when
she opened the Belden House door, to see a
letter for her on the hall table, addressed in
Tom&rsquo;s sprawling, illegible hand. Betty wondered
if he was going back to New Haven by
way of Harding&mdash;which would have been decidedly
the longest way round. But she
glanced at the letter, and, as it seemed to be
all about Georgia, she put it aside to read later
in the day, when she had more time.</p>

<p>Just before dinner she took it up again and
being tired of unpacking, sat down at her
desk to make out Tom&rsquo;s hieroglyphics at her
leisure. But at the bottom of the first page,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>she gave a little cry of dismay, and ran off to
Mary&rsquo;s room, where she found Madeline and
Mary lying on the couch, reading Mary&rsquo;s
Christmas books&mdash;she had had eighteen of
them, and she declared that she simply could
not begin to study until she had read them all
through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; cried Betty, bursting in without
waiting to knock. &ldquo;What do you think has
happened now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, Betty,&rdquo; said Mary, who had been
completely absorbed in her book. &ldquo;How you
frightened me! We&rsquo;re reading. Help yourself
to a book and some candy and be quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mary!&rdquo; began Betty. &ldquo;Listen to
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary dropped her book with a sigh of discouragement.
&ldquo;Talk about the silent cloisters
of learning!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;College is the worst
place I know of to try to work in.&rdquo; She
pulled at Madeline&rsquo;s book. &ldquo;Come, Madeline,
don&rsquo;t try to improve your mind any longer.
Betty is bound to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline looked up lazily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Georgia,&rdquo; explained Betty.
&ldquo;The most dreadful thing you can imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Then the
faculty must have found her a poor joke and
voted to expel all &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; from
Harding.&rdquo; And she returned once more to
her book.</p>

<p>But Mary was still listening and Betty
turned to her. &ldquo;That dreadful Mr. John
Alison has sent Georgia&rsquo;s picture to Dr.
Eaton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s lovely,&rdquo; said Mary calmly.
&ldquo;We ought to have thought of that ourselves.
Where does the dreadfulness come in? And
who is Mr. John Alison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary, don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; began
Betty impatiently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Tom&rsquo;s older brother&mdash;the
one that was in college with Dr. Eaton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard of him,&rdquo; said Madeline, who
had abandoned her book again. &ldquo;How did
he hear of Georgia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Tom Alison wrote him about
her,&rdquo; explained Betty. &ldquo;He thought Georgia
was such a good joke,&mdash;after I&rsquo;d told him
about Alice Waite&rsquo;s using her, you know,&mdash;that
he wanted to know all about her. When
I mentioned Dr. Eaton and English Essayists
he was perfectly delighted. Dr. Eaton used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>to visit his older brother, and they both used
to tease Tom, so of course he approved of our
teasing Dr. Eaton now. He said he was going
to write his brother about it, and he did. He
told him about the Yale part, too, of course,
and he sent him Georgia&rsquo;s picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Mary, as Betty paused
for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read all the letter yet, but I
know that Mr. Alison sent the picture to Dr.
Eaton. Let me see.&rdquo; Betty consulted Tom&rsquo;s
epistle. &ldquo;Here it is. &lsquo;If you will believe it,
John got my letter in Tombstone, Arizona,
where he was spending a day on his way from
San Francisco back to the railroad that he&rsquo;s
building down in New Mexico. He was delighted
with the whole game, and thinking
that Eaton would appreciate that picture, he
sent it along with a note from Georgia which
I guess from his description was a corker.
You see he didn&rsquo;t realize that you girls would
have to stand for it sooner or later, so he
wrote that his&mdash;I mean Georgia&rsquo;s&mdash;heart was
Eaton&rsquo;s for keeps, and that she couldn&rsquo;t bear
the separation and wanted to exchange photographs,
and wouldn&rsquo;t he write her just a line?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>I&rsquo;ve written him &ldquo;just a line&rdquo; to warn him
against taking any such liberties again with
my friends&rsquo; ideas; and I hope that it isn&rsquo;t too
late for you to square yourselves all right.
I&rsquo;ll make John write and apologize, if you say
so. The letter was all right, you see, from
him, but Eaton thinking it was from a girl, of
course wouldn&rsquo;t like the idea. I hope this
doesn&rsquo;t mean the premature death of Georgia,
and I hope Eaton didn&rsquo;t get that letter before
the Christmas recess, but I&rsquo;m awfully afraid
he may have.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That explains the coolness of the professor
the last time you saw him,&rdquo; said Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What geese he must think us,&rdquo; giggled
Mary, &ldquo;to be the friends of the girl who wrote
that dreadful note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who also wrote those ten-minute
tests that he so admired,&rdquo; added Madeline.
&ldquo;I suppose he explains it by referring to the
oddities of genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; suggested Betty, &ldquo;that he
suspects Georgia of being a fake and thinks
we wrote that note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s round
up &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; and have a meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>over at Rachel&rsquo;s. English Essayists meets
day after to-morrow, doesn&rsquo;t it? We must
do something before that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the sad conclusion of &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; that Georgia must die. The utmost
ingenuity of the entire membership could not
avert this unhappy catastrophe. Somebody
must tell Dr. Eaton about Georgia, and explain
that &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; assumed the
responsibility of everything but that last note.
The meeting was also unanimous in its choice
of an envoy. Nobody could beard the lion in
his den so well as Betty Wales.</p>

<p>In vain Betty protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadfully
unfair,&rdquo; she declared hotly. &ldquo;Madeline ought
to do it. Georgia is her double, and she wrote
the themes that Dr. Eaton liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t that enough for one person?&rdquo;
inquired Madeline calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my
share and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Rachel ought to go,&rdquo; began Betty,
but Mary was firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re elected to tell him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
you know very well that when you&rsquo;re elected
by &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; to do a certain thing,
there&rsquo;s no way out. Besides, you&rsquo;re so tactful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>Betty, and you like Dr. Eaton, and he likes
you, and you&rsquo;ve had more fun out of Georgia
than any of the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; broke in Babbie eagerly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to pay up for that bid to the Yale
prom., you know, and for all the candy and
violets. Why, I&rsquo;d go to Dr. Eaton twenty
times over if I could step into your shoes with
Mr. Alison; and you got it all through
Georgia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true, and then, as Mary had said,
there was no way out. &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
had dispensed with reports and motions, but
their &ldquo;elections&rdquo; were as the laws of the
Medes and Persians. So Betty put on her
new furs, by way of keeping up her courage,
and presented herself the next afternoon at
Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s office. She had walked briskly
across the campus, so that her cheeks were
pink, her eyes sparkled, and her dimples were
much in evidence, as, without giving herself
time to get frightened or to think how she
should begin, she knocked on Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s
door.</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton was evidently not expecting
callers so early in the term. His &ldquo;Come in&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>sounded a trifle brusque, and the nod he gave
Betty over the top of his big desk was distinctly
businesslike and chilly. But Betty
clasped her hands tightly inside her beautiful
new muff and kept on smiling a brave little
smile as she crossed the room. He couldn&rsquo;t
be so very disagreeable when he found out
how it all happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your office hour, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
asked doubtfully, as Dr. Eaton pulled forward
a chair for her in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, Miss Wales. What can I do for
you?&rdquo; asked Dr. Eaton in his turn; and
Betty, blushing furiously, plunged straight
into the midst of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Georgia Ames isn&rsquo;t anybody,&rdquo;
she began. &ldquo;We made her all up, you know,&mdash;but
your friend Mr. Alison wrote that dreadful
note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton knit his brows and stared. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;but
will you please say that again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s just an imaginary person,&rdquo; explained
Betty. &ldquo;Madeline Ayres thought of
her first, but she let us use her and we&rsquo;ve had
lots of fun fooling people with her. Madeline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>wrote those themes that you liked so much,
and Helen Adams wrote the Mrs. Erasmus
J. Ames part, and we all helped with the
other things. But that dreadful letter from
Tombstone wasn&rsquo;t ours at all&mdash;or Georgia&rsquo;s.
Your friend, Mr. Alison, sent it and the picture.
So please don&rsquo;t mind. And&mdash;and isn&rsquo;t
it one bit amusing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. John Elliot Eaton still knit his fine
brows and stared at Betty as if she had been a
ghost&mdash;or a double. &ldquo;Miss Wales,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt I seem awfully dense, but I
don&rsquo;t understand yet. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest
idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. Will you
please begin at the beginning and go on very
slowly indeed? And&mdash;I promise to find it
amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a reassuring twinkle in his eyes
now, and Betty breathed a sigh of deep relief
and began again at the beginning, stopping
often to let Dr. Eaton ask questions. When
at last he comprehended the first chapter of
Georgia&rsquo;s experiences, he threw back his head
and laughed till he cried. He repeated this
performance several times during the rest of
the story. Before it was finished, Betty had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>the feeling that she was talking to an old
friend. She liked Dr. Eaton better than ever,
because he liked Georgia, even though she had
completely taken him in; and she was secretly
glad that &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; had &ldquo;elected&rdquo;
her to explain.</p>

<p>When she had arrived once more at Mr.
John Alison&rsquo;s unauthorized &ldquo;touch&rdquo; of sentimentality,
Dr. Eaton interrupted again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alison&rsquo;s a trump,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must write
and thank him for forcing your hand. As
far as I can see you might have gone on fooling
me till June, if he hadn&rsquo;t interfered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Betty solemnly. &ldquo;We
wanted to keep Georgia till spring term,
but Bob&mdash;I mean Miss Marie Parker&mdash;suggested
to-day that we couldn&rsquo;t have done it,
even by having Georgia leave college. You
would have handed in a report of her unfinished
work to Miss Stuart, and then everything
would have come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see the note?&rdquo; asked
Dr. Eaton, rummaging through a drawer of his
desk. &ldquo;Here it is, and you&rsquo;ll find it a beautiful
performance. I must confess,&rdquo; he added
soberly, &ldquo;that it worried me a good deal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>You see, Miss Wales, I&rsquo;m new at teaching, and
I was afraid I hadn&rsquo;t conducted myself discreetly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did it come?&rdquo; asked Betty, laughing
over Mr. Alison&rsquo;s heroics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last morning of last term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that was why you were so cross.
We thought it must have come then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton laughed. &ldquo;Was I cross? I didn&rsquo;t
mean to be. I only meant to be dignified.
You see, Miss Wales, I,&mdash;well, I have a particular
reason for wishing my work here to
be successful. A great deal depends on this
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sudden turn to seriousness reminded
Betty that she had been wasting nearly an
hour of the great Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s afternoon, and
she jumped up to go.</p>

<p>But Dr. Eaton stopped her. &ldquo;You must tell
&lsquo;The Merry Hearts,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I fully
appreciate Georgia, and that I will forgive
them for victimizing me on one condition. I
insist upon being an honorary member of the
club. Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve fairly earned a
membership?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed,&rdquo; laughed Betty. &ldquo;The only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>trouble is that Madeline may black-ball you
because you say nicer things about Georgia&rsquo;s
themes than you do about hers. But I&rsquo;ll do
my best for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Dr. Eaton. &ldquo;Tell Miss
Ayres that I shall have her double&rsquo;s photograph
suitably framed and hung in a conspicuous
place on the walls of my den.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<small><small>A NEW EXCITEMENT</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> unhappy taking-off of Georgia Ames
supplied Harding College with conversation
for a good deal more than the proverbial
nine days. Campus dinner-tables buzzed with
anecdotes about her, a good many of which
&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; themselves had never
heard before. People who knew the &ldquo;English
Essayists&rdquo; chapter of her experiences had
not heard the Yale chapter. Girls who had
laughed over the discomfiture of the Westcott
House senior, who had eventually paid a high
price for her readiness in running off with
Bob&rsquo;s violets, listened eagerly to the story of
Babe&rsquo;s lace handkerchief. And some of them
went forthwith to interview the janitor, thereby
adding a new episode. For the janitor was a
firm believer in ghosts and other apparitions
and saw no reason why Madeline Ayres, whose
interest in Irish fairy-tales had gained his
worshipful admiration, should not possess a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>shadowy double if she chose to. He had a
well-grounded distrust of the B&rsquo;s and vehemently
pooh-poohed their matter-of-fact explanations
of Georgia&rsquo;s movements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to talk, Miss Babe,&rdquo; he
declared, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve seen what I&rsquo;ve seen, and if
Miss Madeline says she has a double I&rsquo;ll believe
her. And if you&rsquo;d be so kind as to return
me that handkerchief, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take you
up in the clock-tower to-night at nine, and tell
you an&rsquo; your friends a few little yarns of old
Erin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a great bribe, for the B&rsquo;s had
wanted to make an evening visit to the clock-tower
ever since the first evening of their
freshman year, when, wandering forlornly
around the campus, they had noticed how
tall and spectral it looked by night; and Babe
sacrificed her precious handkerchief without a
murmur.</p>

<p>The janitor&rsquo;s stories were very creepy indeed,
and Babe and Babbie went home shivering
and clinging tight to Bob, who marched
along bold as a lion. The two timid ones
were sitting on the edge of Babbie&rsquo;s couch,
discussing a gruesome tale of a girl who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>gagged and tied to the bedpost by ghostly
bonds, had watched her lover walk unsuspectingly
upon an open trap-door and fall shrieking
to his fate, when to their horror the door-handle
moved and the door slid slowly open.
At sight of the towering white-robed figure
which entered with a queer, gliding motion,
the two on the bed shrieked wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! It&rsquo;s me&mdash;I,&rdquo; announced Bob&rsquo;s familiar
voice. &ldquo;I only wanted to test my make-up
on you two. I&rsquo;m going out to scare the
night-watchman. I&rsquo;m going to tell him that
I&rsquo;m Georgia Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob&rsquo;s make-up was doubtless excellent, but
much experience with Harding Hallowe&rsquo;en
parties had made the night-watchman extremely
sceptical. He walked boldly up to the
ghost, explained to her that Georgia Ames
&ldquo;wan&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but them girls&rsquo; fool doin&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
turned a deaf ear to her pleadings to be let
into the Belden to see Madeline, and finally
grasped her wrist so tightly that Bob abandoned
her ghostly falsetto and howled for
mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said the night-watchman
wrathfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Miss Parker, and this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>the last time this term that I shall let you in
and not report it.&rdquo; And most ungallantly did
he spread the story of Bob&rsquo;s adventure among
her friends, who teased her unmercifully until
no one could say &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; in Bob&rsquo;s hearing
without paying dear for the liberty.</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton, when he received notice of his
unanimous election to honorary membership
in &ldquo;The Merry Hearts,&rdquo; responded with a note
that even Madeline had to admit was creditable.
In it he expressed the deepest appreciation
of the honor done him. He had not, he said,
been told all the aims and objects of the organization,
but one seemed to be the booming
of Georgia Ames. And so, unless the rest of
the club disapproved, he would do his best
for her by handing in her report to Miss
Stuart.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart, being a rather unapproachable
person, had not heard of Georgia. So she
called upon Dr. Eaton for an explanation,
which he furnished in full detail. He knew
now that Georgia did not exist, he said; but
was it not his duty to give somebody credit
for those extremely real and very clever papers
which he had had the pleasure of examining?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>And Miss Stuart, who looked more unapproachable
than she really was, smiled genially
on all &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; and congratulated
Mary and Betty, whom she knew best, on
having added to the gaiety of life at Harding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all too serious and too self-centred
here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I like the idea of your
club, and I can see that it has a real influence
in the college. There is more good feeling
and less snobbishness this year. And I
haven&rsquo;t forgotten the way you put through the
Japanese tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; promptly invited
Miss Stuart to be an honorary member
too, and she accepted with an eager gratitude
that made the astute Madeline stop to
think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;do you know
I believe Miss Stuart was truly pleased. I believe
she&rsquo;d like to get down off her pedestal
oftener. I&rsquo;ve always thought that quiet, self-contained,
self-sufficient people like her were
perfectly happy, but now I wonder if they are.
That Miss Case in our class, for instance,&mdash;the
one that has a suite of rooms up where Dora
Carlson is, and spends her time buying and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>reading all the new books that come out. Do
you suppose she&rsquo;s ever lonely in that gorgeous
library of hers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;You
know her father and mother are both dead,
and I can&rsquo;t imagine how books and lovely
things and all the money you want could
make up to a girl for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Next time I see
her I&rsquo;m going to ask her to come down and
join us some Saturday evening&mdash;even if she
is as rich as Crœsus and considered an awful
snob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Miss Case came once, and often after
that, and confided to Madeline that she was
always lonely and had longed to make friends
with her class, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to do it, because
she was so shy and so afraid of intruding
where she wasn&rsquo;t wanted. And Madeline
in her turn explained that the best way was
to forget all about yourself and go ahead&mdash;a
rule which in time Miss Case learned to put
in practice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the winter term was speeding
to an end. Mid-years came and went, but
they have few terrors for clear-headed juniors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>who know by experience that the faculty are
oftener kind than cruel, and who have become
expert in arranging their work so as to
get as many days of glorious freedom as possible
at the end of the terrible mid-year week.</p>

<p>And then, just a month before the end of
the term, came an eventful day, full of excitement
for Betty Wales and the rest of
&ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo; The morning was like
all other mornings at Harding, made up of
recitation hours and hurried intervals of
study between. The afternoon began with a
disappointment, for Betty and Madeline had
planned to go skating, and soon after lunch
word came that the ice on the river was not
strong enough and the rink was closed for the
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said Madeline philosophically,
&ldquo;but I think it&rsquo;s growing colder, and we&rsquo;ll go
to-morrow. Let&rsquo;s look up our history topics
for the day after to-morrow now, and then go
for a long walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty agreed to this, and the two were
swinging home in the dusk, when Madeline
proposed that, as it was not quite dinner time,
they stop and call on Miss Hale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you spoke of it,&rdquo; said
Betty. &ldquo;Nan said in her last letter that
Ethel had written her the bluest notes lately.
She told me to go and cheer her up, and I
haven&rsquo;t had a minute since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel&rsquo;s sitting-room was in front on the first
floor of the house where she boarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; said Betty, as they turned in.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look cheerful, with the lamp lit
and the curtains up? I think everybody
ought to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short. &ldquo;Why,
Madeline&mdash;she&rsquo;s&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;d better
go in now, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madeline shortly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
come again in a day or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For full in the cheerful glow of her big
student lamp, Ethel sat, her arms on her
desk, and her face buried in her arms; and
while the girls stood there, unwitting eavesdroppers
of her unhappiness, she lifted her
head and wiped away the tears with a handkerchief
that was already too wet to be very
useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Betty sorrowfully, as they
turned away, &ldquo;I ought to have gone sooner.
I wonder what can be the trouble. Dear me!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>If I was bright enough to be on the faculty
just after I&rsquo;d graduated, seems to me I should
be as proud and happy as a peacock all the
time. Nan says that Ethel was the brightest
and most popular girl in her class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she hates teaching,&rdquo; suggested
Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo; objected Betty, &ldquo;because
she doesn&rsquo;t have to do it. Her family is
very well off, but she has several sisters at
home and she doesn&rsquo;t care one bit for society,
for all she is such a favorite. Nan says it was
always her ambition to teach here. At first
her family didn&rsquo;t like the idea, but now
they&rsquo;re awfully proud of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;whatever the
matter is, &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; will have to
take her in hand. We meet to-night, don&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;in my room. But I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;are you sure Ethel would like
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;but of
course it&rsquo;s just as you say. I only thought
we might tell the B&rsquo;s, who are in her classes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>to jolly her up a little, or make Mary Brooks
come with us when we call. Mary is such a
cheerful person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To all this Betty heartily assented, but when
evening came the B&rsquo;s appeared in costume as
Alice in Wonderland, the White Rabbit, and
the Queen of Hearts. There was a wild
scramble for more costumes, and the Wonderland
party was so absorbing that nobody
thought of anything else until a freshman admirer
of Betty&rsquo;s knocked on the door with a
letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said, staring
about her in blank amazement. &ldquo;But I
thought you&rsquo;d like this letter. It was on the
floor behind the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much. Won&rsquo;t you come
in?&rdquo; asked Betty, who represented the Mock
Turtle, in a costume composed of a gray bathrobe
and tissue paper paws and ears. &ldquo;Would
you please put the letter on the table? You
see my hands are underneath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when she caught sight of the English
stamps and her father&rsquo;s handwriting on the
envelope, she speedily dispensed with the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>cumbering
&ldquo;flippers&rdquo; that Rachel had adjusted
so carefully, and retired to a quiet corner to
read her letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nassau, B. I.,&rdquo; was the heading. &ldquo;Girls,
where is &lsquo;Nassau, B. I.&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded Betty,
reading on down the page as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Madeline frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near Bermuda, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; hazarded
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s near Cuba,&rdquo; asserted Roberta.
&ldquo;My father went there once long ago. He
brought me the loveliest shells. You go out
in a boat, you know, and whatever you see
that you want a man dives down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was interrupted by an ecstatic shriek
from Betty. &ldquo;Girls, what do you think?
Father says it&rsquo;s perfectly lovely there, wherever
it is, and it doesn&rsquo;t take long from New
York, and he wants me to make up a party of
girls and come down for Easter. Did you
ever hear anything so perfectly, perfectly
grand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;only please read us all
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Betty, dancing off the rest
of the mock turtle&rsquo;s costume, &ldquo;I will. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>says that it&rsquo;s lovely at Nassau, B. I., and that
the weather is just right&mdash;it was too hot at Barbadoes,
whatever that is&mdash;and that while it&rsquo;s
not so tropical as the more southerly West
Indies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; interrupted Roberta
triumphantly. &ldquo;You see it is near Cuba.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very beautiful just the same,&rdquo; continued
Betty. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s splendid sailing
and fishing and bathing. But he says that he
and mother are tired of being alone and want
me to join them for their last two weeks, only
of course I can&rsquo;t come down alone, so he suggests&mdash;let
me see. Here it is. &lsquo;When Nan
was in college I remember that she was invited
to join a party of college girls who went to the
Bahamas for their Easter vacation. One of
the faculty who wanted to take the trip acted
as chaperon, and I think made the business
arrangements; but I enclose a list of steamer
sailings and an estimate of expenses, and will
engage hotel accommodations as soon as I hear
from you. So your chaperon&rsquo;s duties will
be merely nominal. I am sure six or eight of
you would enjoy the four days&rsquo; sea voyage and
a week or two here immensely, and both your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>mother and I hope you can arrange to bring
down a congenial party.&rsquo; Oh, girls, can&rsquo;t you
all come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
father to give me the trip as a commencement
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can,&rdquo; declared Madeline.
&ldquo;Father and mother are in Italy, so I may as
well do one thing as another at Easter. They
gave me a check for Christmas, and if that
isn&rsquo;t enough, I&rsquo;ll take the rest of my allowance
money and trust to providence for the
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can go,&rdquo; announced Babbie, speaking
as usual for all the B&rsquo;s. &ldquo;That is&mdash;if our
fond parents are willing. We&rsquo;ll go and write
them this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send it special delivery,&rdquo; advised Mary.
&ldquo;How about you, K.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katherine made a wry face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
you can&rsquo;t count on me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
even afford to go as far as Kankakee this
spring. I&rsquo;m going to stay here and be company
for Rachel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rachel, &ldquo;and you must send us
lots of letters and post-cards, and bring us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>some shells, and an orange apiece that you
really saw growing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we will,&rdquo; said Mary heartily.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have time that week for anything
but reading our letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we shall miss you both dreadfully,&rdquo;
added Betty. &ldquo;How about you, Nita?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go home. I went away at Christmas,
you know. Besides, I have to get my
spring sewing done. What will you girls do
about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do without,&rdquo; laughed Madeline. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
raise doubts in our minds, Nita.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so envious,&rdquo; murmured Nita, sadly,
&ldquo;that I have to think of any small compensations
that may be coming my way, or I
couldn&rsquo;t stand it. Will you go too, Helen
Chase?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen shook her head doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure that I can. I have some money in
the savings bank. I don&rsquo;t know how much,
and anyway probably mother wouldn&rsquo;t want
me to take it. But I&rsquo;ve never been anywhere,
and I can see that traveling is a great education.
Don&rsquo;t you think it would be improving
to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As if it wouldn&rsquo;t be improving to do anything
in our company!&rdquo; laughed Madeline.
&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;that makes&mdash;three B&rsquo;s, Betty,
Mary, Helen perhaps, myself&mdash;&mdash; Why,
Roberta, you haven&rsquo;t announced your intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go of course, if you and Mary do,&rdquo;
said Roberta, calmly. &ldquo;My father always
says &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to me. Sometimes I wish he&rsquo;d say
&lsquo;no&rsquo; to something, so I could be sure he was
really listening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try the experiment this time,&rdquo; said
Mary. &ldquo;How about a chaperon, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can find somebody, I guess,&rdquo; said
Betty, joyously. Then she looked at Madeline.
&ldquo;I know the very person,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Ethel Hale! Let&rsquo;s go this minute and ask
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of us? In these things?&rdquo; asked
Roberta, who was afraid of all the faculty, on
general principles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Betty can
be show man and stage manager, since she&rsquo;s
torn her flippers and lost one ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it happened that Miss Hale, who was
again in her sitting-room reading a wise Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>man
book about the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, heard
a confused rustling in the hall and opened her
door upon a troop of the strangest creatures
she had seen since the Hallowe&rsquo;en party of
her senior year.</p>

<p>Besides the White Rabbit, the Queen of
Hearts and Alice, there was the Cheshire cat,
personated by Mary, wearing her &ldquo;beamish&rdquo;
smile, the mad Hatter,&mdash;Helen, lost in an antiquated
beaver that was one of Madeline&rsquo;s
most valued stage properties,&mdash;and the King
of Hearts and four suit cards wearing placards
like sandwich men, to show their identity.</p>

<p>After Betty had introduced all the Wonderland
people and Miss Hale had admired their
impromptu costumes, Betty explained why
they had come.</p>

<p>To the joy of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts,&rdquo; Miss
Hale consented at once. &ldquo;I should like
nothing better,&rdquo; she said, heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired of snow and cold and hard work, and
the sea voyage and a week on that dear little
green island is just what I need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try not to be the least trouble,&rdquo; said
Babbie, sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll bring up your breakfast every
morning, if you like,&rdquo; said Babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we think you are too nice for anything,
to say yes without being teased,&rdquo; declared
Bob.</p>

<p>Whereat everybody laughed, thanked Miss
Hale, and sped home just in time to escape the
dire calamity of being locked out at the mercy
of the night-watchman or one&rsquo;s kind friends
within doors.</p>

<small><small>&ldquo;THE MERRY HEARTS&rdquo; CONSPIRE</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the remaining four weeks of the term
it is to be feared that &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
took small advantage of their scholastic opportunities
and privileges. There were so many
letters to be written home, first for permission
to join the Nassau party, and then for summer
hats and muslins, to wear on the trip, and so
many consultations to be held about the proper
kind and amount of clothes to take, the possibility
of the Mary-Bird-Club&rsquo;s needing their
glasses for the study of tropical birds, the possibility
of transforming a battered gym suit
into a natty bathing costume at short notice,&mdash;or
would flannel suits be altogether too
warm for the tropics, and if so, would there
be time for a hasty shopping expedition in
New York on the day of sailing? It was surprising
how many problems presented themselves,
besides the essential one of getting the
family&rsquo;s consent for the trip. All the girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>who had hoped to go, secured this without
any trouble, and Helen Adams, who had only
half hoped, was overjoyed to find that her
father and mother fully concurred with her in
thinking that the trip would be improving
enough to warrant her in taking her savings
bank money to eke out what they could afford
to give her. As for the three who could not
go, they were quite as interested in the trip as
their more fortunate friends. Rachel speedily
became the club&rsquo;s authority on West Indian
geography, and Katherine studied the steamship
folders until she could dilate upon the
sights of Nassau as fluently as if she had spent
months there. Indeed Nita declared that it
was really foolish to go to Nassau at all, after
having heard K.&rsquo;s dissertation, because nothing
you saw would be new or surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust a Harding crowd to find something
new!&rdquo; retorted Madeline. &ldquo;With our up-to-date
methods of study and research we shall
understand Nassau in a week as she has never
been understood before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; said Nita forlornly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go there, but now
I shan&rsquo;t want to any more, because you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>have so much grander a time than I possibly
could, if I went in the ordinary way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look as if we were going to
have a grand time though?&rdquo; said Mary gleefully.
&ldquo;Did you know that Miss Hale has
heard from the steamer people? We can all
have state-rooms together, and the boat sails
the very day after college closes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that splendid? Aren&rsquo;t we in luck?
Hurrah for Mr. Wales!&rdquo; cried &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; hilariously. Only Betty Wales, who
was usually the most hilarious of them all,
was silent. She sat still on the couch, her
forehead puckered with lines of deep thought
and her eyes staring very far away. There
was something she wanted to do, but she
was afraid of the B&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you ask and get it over? You think
you ought, and if they don&rsquo;t like it, why they
can say so, and things will be just as they
were before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Would they be just the same, Betty wondered.
The one thing she hated was a &ldquo;fuss.&rdquo;
It was so much easier to slide along quietly,
avoiding disagreeable subjects; but was it al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>ways
right? Betty had been over at the
Hilton that afternoon to see Eleanor. Eleanor
was trying very hard and she was making a
little headway against the tide of opposition
and prejudice that had overwhelmed her.
Girls who didn&rsquo;t know her well were beginning
to say that Miss Watson might be a
cheat for all they knew but she most certainly
wasn&rsquo;t a snob&mdash;she was a good deal pleasanter
and more friendly than some of the ones
who circulated disagreeable stories about her.
This opinion was gaining ground fast. Eleanor
felt its influence and it gave her the
hope to go on. But she had worked very
hard, she was tired and despondent, and she
had just heard from home that her little step-brother
was ill with scarlet fever, and that
she would better not plan to come home for
the Easter vacation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could ask you to come and
see me,&rdquo; cried Betty impulsively, &ldquo;but you
know I&rsquo;m going to the Bahamas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; said Eleanor. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine anything nicer than a southern trip
after this awfully cold, long winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty wondered if she had heard before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>about &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo;&rdquo; cruise, but decided
not to ask. &ldquo;Where will you go, Eleanor?&rdquo;
she said instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, to my aunt in New York, I suppose,&rdquo;
answered Eleanor, uncertainly. &ldquo;Jim is going
to stay with a friend in Montreal, so
there really isn&rsquo;t anything else for me to do.
I love Aunt Flo dearly, but somehow she always
upsets all my ideas. I&rsquo;m beginning to
see now why father doesn&rsquo;t care to have me
go there. Perhaps I shall decide to stay on
here and rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lonely vacation at Harding seemed very
forlorn indeed to Betty. She went home in a
thoughtful mood, and she was still thinking
when her friends drifted in for the customary
after-dinner chat, that now always centred
around the Nassau trip. It would be so
pleasant for Eleanor to join the party; but
would her coming spoil the feeling of good-fellowship
and fun that made all &ldquo;The
Merry Hearts&rsquo;&rdquo; festivities so delightful?</p>

<p>Betty was still considering the question
absently, when she heard Mary say, &ldquo;Why
can&rsquo;t two of us walk with her, pray tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; announced Katherine pom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>pously,
&ldquo;the sidewalks are very narrow.
The folder says so. You ought to be an
even number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the omniscient globe-trotter!&rdquo; jeered
Mary. &ldquo;Well, if you think we ought to be
an even number, counting Miss Hale, why
don&rsquo;t you solve the difficulty by coming
along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; sighed Katherine. &ldquo;Because
unfortunately my father has five other
hungry mouths to feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty slid forward to the edge of the couch.
&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said she in a voice that she tried to
keep cool and even, &ldquo;I know some one that
I think would love to come with us,&mdash;if you
really think an even number would be
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the slightest pause, then, &ldquo;Is it
Eleanor Watson?&rdquo; asked Bob Parker pleasantly.
&ldquo;Because if it is, I move,&mdash;I mean I
say that we have her. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d be no
end jolly. Tell her to bring her mandolin, so
she can play when we go off on moonlight
sails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob Parker, of all persons, championing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>Eleanor&rsquo;s cause! Betty felt as if a thunder-bolt
had fallen, and she waited in awed
silence to see what would happen next. Nothing
happened&mdash;but more thunder-bolts. Babe
said she guessed it was a case of, &ldquo;The more
the merrier.&rdquo; Babbie wondered if Miss Hale
would wish to share her state-room, and suggested
that if another could not be procured
for Eleanor, the three B&rsquo;s could easily crowd
into one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We often sleep three in a single bed, you
know,&rdquo; she explained. Then Mary in matter-of-fact
tones announced that she, Babbie, and
Betty would go over at once to invite Eleanor,
and would report to the rest after study hours.
It was all as simple as simple could be. After
the meeting had broken up and the envoys
had started for the Hilton House, Betty remembered
suddenly that she had not even told
the girls why she had particularly wanted to
include Eleanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we were just as glad to have her without
knowing that,&rdquo; declared Babbie earnestly
after Betty had explained. &ldquo;This is sort of
your party, you know, Betty. And besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Bob has been just hoping you&rsquo;d give her a
chance to make up for what she did last fall&mdash;when
Georgia joined &lsquo;The Merry Hearts.&rsquo;
She never meant to be so rude and she was
awfully ashamed and wanted to make up for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eleanor received the invitation in the same
cordial spirit in which it was tendered, and
accepted it so gratefully that any lurking regrets
in the minds of the B&rsquo;s were speedily
dispelled.</p>

<p>As Mary put it, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re cozy as we are, but
coziness isn&rsquo;t everything. And anyhow this is
Betty&rsquo;s party, and of course it must go along
according to Betty&rsquo;s ideas&mdash;which are always
nice after you&rsquo;ve got used to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s party&rdquo; certainly bid fair to be a
great success. Her eyes had not ceased sparkling
over Judge Watson&rsquo;s telegram of thanks,
sent to her personally, as his &ldquo;daughter&rsquo;s best
friend,&rdquo; when something else happened quite
different but equally exciting. Mary and her
chum Marion Lawrence appeared at dinner
one evening fairly bursting with suppressed
importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the latest news?&rdquo; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>teased. "Guess! Has it anything to do with
you? Easily! Oh, wait till after dinner, and
then perhaps Laurie can be induced to tell. I
couldn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s her news&mdash;her scoop, as
they say in the newspaper offices. You can&rsquo;t
expect me to steal her scoop," ended Mary
piously.</p>

<p>So after dinner the Belden House &ldquo;Merry
Hearts&rdquo; besieged Marion in a corner, and by
dint of bribes and threats finally got at the
great item. &ldquo;Did any of you happen to know
that Dr. Eaton is going to a place called Nassau
at Easter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Really?&rdquo; cried Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find out?&rdquo; demanded
Roberta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of Mary&rsquo;s rumors,&rdquo; declared Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; retorted Mary with dignity.
&ldquo;Tell them how you heard, Laurie, and then
perhaps they&rsquo;ll believe you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Met him down-town,&rdquo; began Marion in
her most businesslike fashion. &ldquo;We walked
up together, and he said he&rsquo;d been buying a
new steamer trunk because his old one was
falling to pieces. He seems to have been to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>Egypt several times, and to Alaska and Japan
and pretty nearly everywhere else, and now
he&rsquo;s going to Nassau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo; demanded Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly he did. He said he had heard
it was very quaint and English, and that for so
short a time he thought he should prefer it to
Havana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps he&rsquo;s going by rail,&rdquo; suggested
Betty. &ldquo;Father and mother did that, and
then they crossed over from Florida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that,&rdquo; answered Marion
doubtfully, &ldquo;only he seemed to be counting
on several days at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he must be going from New York,&rdquo;
declared Nita eagerly. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s four days from
New York, it can&rsquo;t be much over one from
Florida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed Mary, while her
fellow-voyagers exchanged delighted glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he goes from New York he must
take the same boat we do,&rdquo; went on Betty,
&ldquo;because there isn&rsquo;t any other. Oh, Marion,
did you tell him we were going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I thought I&rsquo;d keep it for a
pleasant little surprise. He&rsquo;s so extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>fond of girls&mdash;though you people seem to be
shining exceptions to that rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t tell him,&rdquo; said Roberta
hastily. &ldquo;I only hope I can keep out of his
way. Do you suppose he and Miss Hale know
each other any?&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be
joyous news to Miss Hale? When she gets
tired of our childish chatter, she can talk
history and literature with Dr. Eaton. Did
you ever hear her mention him, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty, doubtfully, &ldquo;but she
knows him a little anyhow. I remember he
went home with her from our faculty-party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; began Mary suddenly, &ldquo;I have an
idea! Don&rsquo;t you know how romances always
begin on shipboard? Let&rsquo;s encourage a romance
between the learned lady and the
learned doctor. Miss Hale is so pretty and
attractive that she ought to get married instead
of burying herself up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cried Katherine, who was
dining at the Belden with Betty. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
much too nice to turn into a prim, old-maidish
blue-stocking. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Betty
Wales?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty laughed and blushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully
fond of her, and I think she&rsquo;s nice enough for
anything, but I think we must be very careful
not to embarrass her or make it uncomfortable
for her in any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; promised Mary
easily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give her the time of her gay
young life. &lsquo;Merry Hearts&rsquo;&mdash;match-makers&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
that sound well? Betty, do you
agree not to tell Miss Hale that Dr. Eaton is
coming? We&rsquo;d better surprise her too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Betty, who had an uncomfortable suspicion
that if Ethel knew about Dr. Eaton,
the Nassau party would be straightway minus
a chaperon, gladly promised. &ldquo;For we&rsquo;re not
to blame,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;as long as we didn&rsquo;t
tell him we were going. And if she should
back out now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s expression indicated
the depths of gloom into which such a
calamity would plunge her.</p>

<p>As if the southern voyagers had not already
had sufficient unexpected and exciting blessings
showered upon them by a kindly providence,
something else had to happen at the
very last moment. The something else was
not on the face of it a blessing. It was a fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob Parker discovered it. Coming up to
her room on the fourth floor two full hours
later than any Harding damsel is supposed to
be awake, she happened to look out the window
at the head of the stairs, and saw a strange
light in the Main Building, which was just
across the lawn from the Westcott. Bob was
an extremely clear-headed young person. She
rushed into Babbie&rsquo;s room and then into
Babe&rsquo;s, commanding them to rouse the house
and dress, so as to be ready in case there was
anything girls could do to help. Then she
fled down-stairs and out of the house in pursuit
of her sworn enemy, the night-watchman,
who cast one doubting glance in the
direction she indicated, and ran for the nearest
alarm box. Then he and Bob went together
to the burning building, and Bob guarded the
outer door, while he pushed up through the
smoke to find out where the fire was and how
big it had grown before Bob noticed it. A
minute later the fire company arrived and the
fight began.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much of a fire, as fires go, but it
had started&mdash;nobody ever knew how&mdash;in the
library, the very worst place it could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>chosen; for every stream of water that the
firemen played meant the destruction of
shelvesful of valuable books. But Bob had
an idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Westcott girls are dressed,&rdquo; she said to
the fire chief. &ldquo;Let them make a line and
pass out the books by armfuls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the girls worked valiantly, despite the
smoke that filled the hallways, and under
Bob&rsquo;s gallant leadership saved a great part of
the valuable Harding library.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fire had crept under the
flooring and burst out in a recitation room directly
beneath the library. But it was soon
under control, and just as the first streaks of
flame color brightened the gray east the
sleepy Westcott girls filed home, leaving the
night-watchman and a fireman or two to keep
a lookout for further outbreaks.</p>

<p class="bgap">Bob slept like a log till ten. On her way to
an eleven o&rsquo;clock class she met the night-watchman,
grinning from ear to ear and
bursting with importance.</p>

<p class="center caption">THE GIRLS WORKED VALIANTLY</p>

<p class="gap">&ldquo;The president seen me about last night
and he said to me, &lsquo;You done noble, Henry.&rsquo;
Them was his very words, Miss Parker&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>very words. I guess he&rsquo;ll say the same to
you, when next he sees you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I hope so! I hope he&rsquo;ll say it just that
way,&rdquo; laughed Bob, resolving to seek out the
president at once and cheer him with Henry&rsquo;s
unconscious humor.</p>

<p>The next day there was a mass meeting of
the student body. The Main Building was a
good deal injured and the sorting, repairing
and rearranging the library would be a work
of time. The president wondered if loyalty
to the best interests of the college would make
the students willing to lengthen their Easter
recess by a week, and stay on a week longer in
June. The president was very popular and
the students voted unanimously to do as he
wished; but &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; voted with
both hands. &ldquo;One for ourselves and one for
the college,&rdquo; as Mary put it. For was not an
extra week the only thing they needed to
make their Nassau trip perfect? Mr. Wales
had urged them to get permission to stay over,
but Mary declared that the mere request
would endanger her diploma, and Helen and
Eleanor looked so grave over the proposal
for different reasons that Betty had said no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>more about it. And now they had had a
present of the extra week. It was all too good
to be true.</p>

<small><small>&ldquo;THE MERRY HEARTS&rdquo; ABROAD</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> was there such a bustling, confused,
hurried, but withal happy departure from
Harding as &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; made on the
last day of the long winter term. The stay-at-homes&mdash;Rachel,
Katherine, Nita and little
Dora Carlson&mdash;were all at the station to see
them off and wish them a successful journey.
They left at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and
their boat sailed the same afternoon at five.
There would not be time in New York, therefore,
for anything but to get themselves and
their baggage across the city and safely on
shipboard. Madeline and Mary, the experienced
travelers of the party, were &ldquo;elected&rdquo;
to attend to the trunks, for Miss Hale was suffering
with a bad headache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; as Mary told her, "we don&rsquo;t
want you to bother with anything like that.
You are just to tell us what to do and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>not to do, and then to sit still and see that we
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Miss Hale had laughingly responded
that she should not forget for a minute
that she was mistress of nine willing slaves;
and she had submitted without a protest to
being tucked up comfortably in a corner of her
seat, with Betty&rsquo;s suit case for a foot-rest and
Madeline&rsquo;s steamer-rug for a pillow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the matter that was agitating
&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; was the whereabouts of
Dr. Eaton. Was he going to Florida by rail
after all? Or had he missed the train? Perhaps
he was ill; he almost always came to
chapel, and everybody was positive that he
had not been there that morning. Finally an
off-campus senior, who took her meals at the
same house where he did, was appealed to for
information, and she quickly solved the difficulty.
Dr. Eaton had gone away the night
before. &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; breathed a sigh
of relief. They were becoming vastly interested
in Mary&rsquo;s match-making scheme. Indeed
Betty Wales was a little worried lest
their well-meant enthusiasm should carry
some of them too far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be one bit afraid,&rdquo; Mary reassured
her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re awfully sensible, you
know, when we try to be. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
suppose we shall have to do anything but just
watch proceedings. Judging by all the stories
you read, I should say that you almost have
to fall in love on shipboard, because there&rsquo;s
nothing else to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The time and the place,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Madeline.
&ldquo;Then how about the rest of us, Mary?
Do you expect us all to fall in love too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary surveyed the group scornfully. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you are children,
far too young even to think of such things.
As for me, I shall have the responsibility
of you all on my shoulders.&rdquo; Mary sighed
deeply. &ldquo;Let me see; is it you, Betty, or
Roberta, whose trunk is to go in the hold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; said Roberta, shivering forlornly.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this car cold, girls? I know I shall
never want all those thin dresses that I put
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train reached New York on time and
the transit across the city was made without
mishap. Eleanor&rsquo;s aunt was at the boat to
see her off, and she had brought a carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>full of flowers, fruit, and candy for Eleanor
and her friends, so that the state-rooms looked
very festive indeed, and Mary declared that she
felt as if she was starting on a wedding trip to
Europe at the very least.</p>

<p>Miss Hale, who had warned &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; that she was always seasick, went to
her state-room as soon as the boat swung off,
and the girls, most of whom hadn&rsquo;t had experience
enough to know whether they should
be seasick or not, arranged their belongings
as comfortably as possible for the voyage, and
then, all but Roberta, who had already begun
to feel very miserable indeed, made ready to
answer the call of the supper-gong. The
boat was not at all crowded, for the season of
southern travel was nearly over; but that
made the girls all the more anxious to get
a look at their fellow-voyagers, and particularly
to see if Dr. Eaton was among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Mary Brooks sententiously, &ldquo;it
makes all the difference in the world. Either
this is going to be a novel with a hero, or a
novel without a hero, and it takes a regular
genius to write that kind, so I guess we&rsquo;d
better not attempt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mary was just marshalling her little
flock in the passage when Dr. Eaton opened
the door of a state-room across the way, and
came toward them with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he demanded, nodding to
Betty and the B&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Is this an expedition
of &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; that I haven&rsquo;t been
told of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty explained that it wasn&rsquo;t exactly that&mdash;that
it only happened that most of the
travelers were also members of the club; and
then she introduced Dr. Eaton to every one
that he did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you must let me escort you
down to supper,&rdquo; said Dr. Eaton, falling in
beside Betty. &ldquo;You say you&rsquo;re going to
Nassau to meet your father and mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; explained Betty, &ldquo;but we have a
chaperon besides. It&rsquo;s Miss Hale. You know
her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Eaton glanced hastily over the little
company. &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Which one
is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; explained Betty
again. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s seasick,&mdash;or at least she&rsquo;s expecting
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Miss Ethel Hale?&rdquo; asked Dr. Eaton,
in a tone that was unmistakably eager. Betty
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;very pleasant,&rdquo; stammered
Dr. Eaton. &ldquo;I&mdash;I do know her, but I didn&rsquo;t
know she was going to take this trip. May I
ask, Miss Wales, if she knows that I am
on board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Betty hastily, wondering
why he should be so dreadfully embarrassed,
and hoping that she was not nipping Mary&rsquo;s
romance in the bud. &ldquo;Or at least I don&rsquo;t
think that she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Dr. Eaton soberly.</p>

<p>The next minute he had stepped ahead of
Mary and was asking the steward for places
for a party of eleven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, when they were all
seated, &ldquo;I insist upon being counted in with
the rest of the club, even if I did get here by
accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because Dr. Eaton talked so
entertainingly all through the meal, or perhaps
the big bunch of roses that Eleanor had
put in the middle of the table had something
to do with it. At any rate &ldquo;The Merry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Hearts&rdquo; forgot their fear of seasickness, and
ate a good dinner; and no one but Roberta
was ill for a minute of the trip. Mary insisted
that even Roberta was not really seasick&mdash;that
she was just shamming, so that she
could lie in bed all day, and be waited on,
and have Dr. Eaton and Miss Hale send her
sympathetic messages.</p>
<p>Dr. Eaton did not send any sympathetic
messages to Miss Hale. He did not even inquire
for her, but when on the second afternoon,
she surprised the girls by coming up on
deck, he was the first one to see her and to
spring to take her rug and her book, and put
her steamer chair in a sheltered corner, out
of the way of the saucy little breeze that was
blowing the blue sea into the tiniest of ripples.</p>

<p class="bgap">There was a party of Harvard men on
board, several of whom Mary knew, and after
they had been duly presented to Miss Hale, it
was the most natural thing in the world for
the young people to drift back to the ship&rsquo;s
railing, leaving Dr. Eaton to sit down in the
chair next Ethel&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="center caption">HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SEE HER</p>

<p class="gap">Betty and Mary Brooks, however, were not
too engrossed in the sail-hunting match that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>Bob had proposed, to notice the manner of the
two in the steamer chairs. At first Ethel
looked troubled, and Betty was sure, though
she never told Mary so, that she was almost
ready to cry. But after a few minutes&rsquo; earnest
talk between them she smiled and nodded an
emphatic assent to something Dr. Eaton had
said, and presently they were promenading
the little deck together in the most sociable
fashion, stopping occasionally to hear how the
sail-hunting match was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; said Mary triumphantly,
recounting it all to Roberta
later. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a splendid beginning
already, and the Merry Match-makers haven&rsquo;t
lifted a finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only trouble was that the splendid beginning
stubbornly refused to develop. During
the rest of the voyage Miss Hale and Dr.
Eaton were apparently on an easy, friendly
footing, as two people who have taught in the
same college for a year, and met at chapel and
faculty meetings and at various social functions,
might be expected to be. But after
their first talk, they seemed to avoid being
alone together. Without making any ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>parent effort,
Ethel always happened to be
attended by some of her nine slaves, and there
was nothing for Dr. Eaton to do but talk
cheerfully to the rest of the nine. Whether
or not he wished to talk to Miss Hale instead,
was a question on which &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
were divided.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girls were enjoying to the
full what was for most of them their first taste
of ocean travel. Every day the sea and the
sky grew bluer, and the little breeze softer
and more languorous. There was one last
dreadful night when the ship tossed up and
down on the rolling swells of the Gulf Stream.
But toward morning the tossing ceased, things
stopped tumbling about the state-rooms, and
when the girls awoke the sun was shining on
a sea as calm as a mill-pond, and the ship was
anchored just outside the low, gray reef that
blocks the entrance to Nassau harbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m going to see my father and
mother to-day,&rdquo; cried Betty Wales, jumping
up in great excitement. She was the first one
of the party to be dressed and on deck, and
there to her delight were Mr. and Mrs. Wales
in a little launch, waiting to meet the party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>and take them in to the wharf. Betty waved
them a frantic greeting, then flew back to tell
the rest to hurry, and presently they were one
by one making the precarious descent down
the ship&rsquo;s side. Betty went first, because it
was her father and mother, and Roberta last
because she was so dreadfully frightened and
only consented to go at all after the captain
had promised to rescue her himself if she fell
overboard, and Mr. Wales had assured her
that there was yellow fever in Havana, whither
the ship was bound. Roberta had just decided
that drowning was preferable to fever,
and had reached the shelter of the launch in
safety, when Dr. Eaton appeared on deck, and
waved a friendly good-bye to &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wales. Betty
explained. &ldquo;Then tell him to come to shore
with us,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty
of room for one more, and I need a man to
defend me against all these ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Betty called back the invitation, and
Dr. Eaton ran down the ladder and dropped
into the boat with an easy indifference that
made Roberta sigh with envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The excitement of disembarking over, the
girls had time to look around them, and there
were &ldquo;Ohs!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ahs!&rdquo; of surprise and
pleasure from everybody. The launch slipped
through the narrow entrance to the harbor,
and skirted the long, low island that sheltered
it and shut it in from the open sea. The
shores of this island were covered with a
luxuriant growth of bushes, not distinctively
tropical in appearance; but the island across
the way&mdash;Mr. Wales explained that it was
called New Providence, and that Nassau was
the name of its town, which was also the
capital of the Bahama group of islands&mdash;New
Providence was dotted with groups of tall
palms, a queer old fort crowned the hill, and
the houses that lined the water-front and
straggled up the steep streets toward the fort,
had an unmistakably foreign air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d know in a minute that you were
out of the United States,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The States,&rsquo; you must call them down
here,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Wales.</p>

<p>But it was the harbor, more than the town,
that had made &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; wonder
and exclaim. Its opalescent waters sparkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>and shimmered in the sunlight, showing
every conceivable shade and tint of blue,
green and purple. Patches of green so pale as
to be almost white lay close to pools stained a
rich, deep purple. Why was it? It could not
be the effect of cloud shadows, for there was
not a cloud in the sky.</p>

<p>Mr. Wales, being appealed to, explained that
the iridescence was due to the remarkable
clearness of the water. Sand, white coral
rock, reefs coated with sponges or with dark
sea-weeds,&mdash;each showed its color through the
perfectly transparent water of the harbor.</p>

<p>The launch was steered by a bright-looking
mulatto boy, who had listened intently to the
conversation. When Mr. Wales had finished
his explanation, he smiled broadly and joined
in the talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do tell an awful funny story &rsquo;bout
that water, mass&rsquo;r,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Onct a
woman come down here from the States. She
buy shells and sponges to tek home, but she
lak the water bes&rsquo; of all. So she get some
little bottles, and she hire a black boy to fill
&rsquo;em with all the diff&rsquo;rent kinds, and she label
&rsquo;em and tek &rsquo;em home. An&rsquo; when she pour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&rsquo;em out to show her fren&rsquo;s, they all come
white&mdash;all jus&rsquo; the same. An&rsquo; the lady she
awful sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody laughed and Mrs. Wales said she
hoped the poor woman hadn&rsquo;t had to pay
duty on her water.</p>

<p>Just as she had finished speaking, there was
a loud splash in front of the boat, and the
girls looked around to see three black men
swimming toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw a penny, mass&rsquo;r! Throw a penny,
please!&rdquo; they shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? What are they doing?&rdquo; demanded
the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; answered Mr. Wales, and taking
a big copper coin from his pocket he threw it
toward the men. Before it hit the surface of
the water all three were after it. One caught
it as it fell, but another knocked it out of his
hand, and then all three dived for it. The
girls crowded to the side of the boat to watch
proceedings, and sure enough, though the
boatman said the water was twenty feet deep,
it was so clear that they could see distinctly
when one of the men, feeling along the bottom,
reached the coin and, sputtering and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>coughing, came up to the surface with it.
Instead of going back to his boat to rest, he
calmly put the coin in his mouth, and paddled
lazily about, joining in the shouts of his
companions for more pennies.</p>

<p>The girls began searching for small change,
and Roberta, who wanted to take a picture of
the divers, was recklessly holding out a quarter,
when Mr. Wales discovered her predicament
and gave her an English half-penny instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought a stock of them along,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;for I thought the divers would
amuse you girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the men had seen the glint of Roberta&rsquo;s
quarter, and they swam close up to the launch,
crying, &ldquo;Throw us siller for &rsquo;sperience, lady,&rdquo;
until Roberta gave it to them after all, declaring
that she had more than her money&rsquo;s
worth of fun out of watching their frantic
efforts to capture the big prize.</p>

<p>The men followed the boat till it reached
the wharf, and immediately the picturesque
sights on shore engrossed the girls&rsquo; attention.
&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; cried Betty, pointing to a
funny little gray donkey harnessed to a dilap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>idated
dump-cart on which was perched a
tall, lank negro boy. His clothes were very
ragged, and the harness looked as if it might
have been mended with the loose bits of them.
Odds and ends of string and strips of parti-colored
cloth entirely covered up the leather,
if there had ever been any.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you suppose he would stand for his
picture?&rdquo; asked Eleanor, who, like Roberta,
was a camera fiend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly will, if you give him a half-penny
for doing it,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales, producing
his last copper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that horse!&rdquo; cried Bob, as a diminutive
pony, harnessed much like the donkey,
dashed madly down the street and deliberately
ran full tilt into a lamp-post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a native horse,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Wales. &ldquo;See, he&rsquo;s blindfolded. Most of
them are only half-broken and are driven that
way. Be careful that you don&rsquo;t any of you
get run over while you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t go up on the sidewalks, do
they?&rdquo; inquired Babbie, anxiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Wales laughed. &ldquo;I guess not often,
but most of the streets haven&rsquo;t any sidewalks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>You have to walk in the road most of the
time here. And remember that you must
pass to the left instead of to the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; exclaimed Babbie. &ldquo;Need
we ride up to the hotel, Mr. Wales? I think
we ought to get some practice right away in
passing to the left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody preferred to walk, and the party
set out forthwith. Mr. Wales had already
told the girls that the main hotel down on the
water-front had filled up unexpectedly, and
that in order to give them all rooms near together
the manager had offered to open the
&ldquo;annex&rdquo; up on the hill. This was really another
hotel that the owners of the Colonial
had recently bought. &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
would have it and its beautiful grounds practically
to themselves, and would be driven
down to the main hotel three times a day for
their meals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The annex is really much prettier and
cooler than the Colonial,&rdquo; explained Mrs.
Wales. &ldquo;We wanted to move up there with
you, but we decided that it would be foolish
for so short a time. Besides, all the sail-boats
leave from our wharf, and our piazzas over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>look
the bay. So it&rsquo;s really pleasanter to
have some of us in one place, where there&rsquo;s
more breeze, and some in the other, where
the water is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the sun hot, though?&rdquo; sighed Babe,
as they climbed one of the steep streets that
lead up to the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll soon get used to that,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wales cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Wales.
&ldquo;It takes more than a week or two to get
used to tropical sunshine, I think. But
there&rsquo;s one comfort; you don&rsquo;t need to do anything
while you&rsquo;re here but sit on a shady
piazza and look at the bay and the flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, mother,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Wales.
&ldquo;Do you think these girls have come down
here to sit still and twirl their thumbs?
There&rsquo;s a cricket match this afternoon, girls,
up at the golf-club. Want to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we do!&rdquo; chorused &ldquo;The Merry
Hearts&rdquo; eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then get unpacked, and come to lunch
with your thinnest dresses on,&rdquo; said Mr.
Wales. &ldquo;Here we are at your hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was a chorus of delighted ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>clamations,
as &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; climbed
the terrace and found themselves in a park of
tropical loveliness. Great silk-cotton trees,
with their strangely gnarled roots and wide-spreading
branches, and feathery-leaved
tamarinds shut out the glare of the sunlight.
Banana-trees waved their great leaves, torn
into shreds by the winds. Hibiscus bushes,
starred with scarlet blossoms, bordered the
paths. Yellow jasmine climbed the trellises
of an arbor. At their feet beds of violets and
sweet alyssum perfumed the air, and overhead
myriads of gaily colored birds chirped
and warbled among the green branches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like fairy-land!&rdquo; cried Roberta.</p>

<p>But the great white hotel, with its wide,
vine-sheltered verandas, bespoke more substantial
comforts than fairies would need.
The girls hurried in to unpack, for it was
almost time for lunch and the cricket
match.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And by the way,&rdquo; announced Mr. Wales,
as he bid the party good-bye on the veranda,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Eaton to go with us this afternoon.
He&rsquo;s stopping at the Colonial, he tells me.
He seems like a fine fellow, and besides, I&rsquo;ve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>got to have somebody to help me keep all you
girls straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary gave Betty a significant pinch, as they
followed the turbaned black woman, who was
in charge of the annex, up-stairs to their
rooms. But unfortunately her hopes were
speedily dashed. Ethel had seen plenty of
cricket in England, and she had arranged to
spend the afternoon in the shade with Mrs.
Wales.</p>

<p>This disappointment did not in the least
prevent &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; from having a
delightful time. The cricket match was on
the golf grounds, and the golf grounds proved
to be the fields around an old Spanish fort&mdash;not
the little boat-shaped one that the girls
had seen from the harbor in the morning, and
noticed again just behind and above their
hotel, but another one much larger and a
great deal more interesting, for most of it was
underground.</p>

<p>The cricket match was over early, so that
there was plenty of time before dark for a
visit to the fort. An English soldier was supposed
to be in charge, but Friday afternoon
was a half holiday, the soldier was merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>-making
like the rest of the Nassau people,
and his small son, who was black as the ace
of spades and who said that his name was
Philip Charles Augustus Smith was acting as
guard and guide in his father&rsquo;s stead. First
he took the party up in the lookout tower,
which commanded a fine view of the town,
the island, and the harbor, and then, getting
a light-wood torch, he showed them through
the great range of underground chambers,
cut in years gone by by convict labor out of
the solid coral rock, which cuts almost as
easily as putty when it is first exposed to the
air. There was the governor&rsquo;s chamber with
its one grated window, the prisoners&rsquo; quarters
with no air at all, save what could come
through a long winding shaft, barrack rooms
for several thousand soldiers, a vault for storing
powder, and, most interesting of all, a
well to supply the garrison with water.
Philip Charles Augustus Smith felt in his
pockets and produced several pebbles, which
he threw down this well; and the visitors
were amazed at the interval that elapsed between
the tossing of the stone and its splash
in the water far below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally they mounted a dizzying spiral
stairway into the upper air, and went home
in the cool of the afternoon to tell Mrs.
Wales and Miss Hale all about their adventures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wales, when they had
finished, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;ve come. Mr.
Wales has rested so long that he is boiling
over with energy. Don&rsquo;t let him tire you
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tire out a crowd of Harding College
girls!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Wales scornfully. &ldquo;I
guess there&rsquo;s no danger of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pretty active, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; admitted
Babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s so much to see,&rdquo; added Babbie
sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if Katherine Kittredge did try to
steal all our thunder,&rdquo; concluded Bob. &ldquo;I
guess we shall need our extra week all right
if we&rsquo;re going to take in everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; said Eleanor that evening, as the
girls sat in Betty&rsquo;s rooms in the dark, indulging
in good-night confidences, &ldquo;I never saw
such a thoughtful man as your father is. He
doesn&rsquo;t leave a thing undone for any one&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>pleasure. Have you seen Miss Hale&rsquo;s orange-blossoms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Did father send them
to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Eleanor,
&ldquo;because certainly none of us did, and when
I went in just now to see if her ice-water had
come up all right, there was a great bunch of
them on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably he did send them then,&rdquo; assented
Betty carelessly. &ldquo;He and mother are both
awfully fond of Ethel, and of course they feel
ever so much indebted to her for coming down
here with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next morning when Betty went in
to escort Miss Hale to breakfast, the orange-blossoms
had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I threw them away,&rdquo; Ethel explained,
when Betty ventured to inquire for them.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear the fragrance of them in a
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father didn&rsquo;t send them at all,&rdquo; Betty
decided swiftly. &ldquo;It was Dr. Eaton, and
Ethel wouldn&rsquo;t keep them on that account.
I do wonder why she dislikes him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But for reasons of her own Betty did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>confide her theory about the donor of the
flowers to her match-making friends. She had
a feeling that, since she knew Ethel so much
better than the rest did, she was pledged, so to
speak, to stand between her and the absurd
schemes of the match-makers. For Ethel
was tired and unhappy&mdash;so she and Madeline
had discovered&mdash;and when people are unhappy
they don&rsquo;t always appreciate fun and
jokes. To be sure, Ethel had seemed to appreciate
all the fun they had had so far on the
trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help thinking,&rdquo; Betty reflected,
&ldquo;that she wouldn&rsquo;t like this. Dr. Eaton
must have offended her in some way that he
doesn&rsquo;t know about&mdash;though it isn&rsquo;t like Ethel
to harbor a grudge. He evidently doesn&rsquo;t
suspect how she feels&mdash;or yes&mdash;maybe that
was why he was so embarrassed when he
found that she was with us. Oh, dear! it&rsquo;s
all awfully complicated. But it&rsquo;s a great
deal too hot down here to argue about it
with Mary Brooks, so I shall just let them
get all the fun they can out of thinking the
other way&mdash;as long as they don&rsquo;t bother
Ethel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts, little sister,&rdquo;
said Ethel, wondering at her companion&rsquo;s
unaccustomed silence.</p>

<p>Betty came out of her brown study with a
guilty start. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a penny,&rdquo; she
retorted gaily. &ldquo;You gave all yours to
Roberta, so that she could take as many
pictures as she wanted without using dimes
to pay the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;</span> had started out
bright and early, intent upon making their first
whole day of sight-seeing as long as possible.
They were glad to find that the weather was a
shade cooler, and that the blinding glare of
the sunshine was veiled by thin clouds. At
breakfast they announced their intention of
visiting Grant&rsquo;s Town, and invited Mr. and
Mrs. Wales to join their party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grant&rsquo;s Town?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Wales.
&ldquo;I never heard of it. Where is it? And
what is it? And how did you hear about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the negro settlement up on the hill,&rdquo;
answered Betty. &ldquo;The old black woman who
has charge of our hotel told us about it. She
says that the yards up there are a lot prettier
than the grounds of either hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales briskly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to Grant&rsquo;s Town this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wales and Miss Hale were loath to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>leave the shade of the Colonial&rsquo;s piazza, but
even they had to admit, after they had been
persuaded to see it, that Grant&rsquo;s Town was
well worth visiting.</p>

<p>Eleanor acted as guide, because it was she
who had had the conversation about Grant&rsquo;s
Town with the colored maid. &ldquo;We go straight
up Market Street,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Market
Street starts from the town market, which
is somewhere on this long street that skirts
the water&mdash;Bay Street, the woman called it&mdash;the
one that your hotel is on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently they came to the market, and Mr.
Wales wanted to stop and exhibit that to his
party, but Eleanor objected. &ldquo;The best time
to see the market is before breakfast,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much left by this
time, and if we wait now, it may be too hot
to go to Grant&rsquo;s Town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Wales, with a laughing remark to
Ethel about the difficulty of managing these
college girls, with their superior information,
admitted that Eleanor&rsquo;s council was wiser.</p>

<p>Market Street gradually changed from a
closely built highway, lined with little shops
and shabby wooden houses built close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>street, to a shaded country road with walled
gardens and orchards on either side of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the governor&rsquo;s estate,&rdquo; said Mr.
Wales presently. &ldquo;Did you know this was
the governor&rsquo;s estate, young ladies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young ladies had not known it. They
were straightway all interest, and were greatly
disappointed to hear that the governor&rsquo;s
grounds were private.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still we can see a lot from here,&rdquo; said
Helen. &ldquo;What is that tree with those lovely
red blossoms? And what is that purple
vine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll
ask this woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they waited for the negro woman who
was swinging up the hill toward them at a
fast walk. On her head she carried a great
flat wooden tray filled with dozens of tomatoes,
some eggs, and a few heads of lettuce.
Under one arm she had tucked away a big
white hen, and in the other hand she carried
some slices of fish, strung on a forked stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, but she must have a big family!&rdquo;
said Bob, when the woman had answered their
questions and hurried on. &ldquo;It would take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>whole regiment of children to eat all those
tomatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow her,&rdquo; suggested Roberta.
&ldquo;Then perhaps we can take the children&rsquo;s
pictures. I brought along a whole lot of coppers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman turned in at one of the first of
the little houses that suddenly began to crowd
the road at the foot of the next hill, and she
had no children at all, so she informed the inquiring
Bob. She kept a store. That is to
say, a big table was set across the room, just
inside the open door of her cottage, and on
this improvised counter she was arranging her
wares when the visitors came up with her.
The girls found that there were any number
of these little shops in Grant&rsquo;s Town. Every
morning the proprietors, starting often before
daylight, went down to the market for supplies,
and the neighborhood saved itself the
long walk through the sun by patronizing
the little local stores. Other negro women
carried their heaped-up trays through the
white settlement, bringing to their regular
customers the choicest fruits and vegetables
that the day&rsquo;s market afforded. So it soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>grew to seem perfectly natural to see eggs,
oranges, tomatoes, and other kinds of &ldquo;rolling
stock,&rdquo; as Mary flippantly named them, carried
about on the heads of graceful, swiftly
moving negresses, who stopped to chat with
their friends, laughed, talked, turned their
heads unconcernedly this way and that, but
never spilled anything.</p>

<p>The adventurous Bob made friends with an
old woman who sold cocoanut cakes on the
streets near their hotel. One day when the
girls had bought out nearly all her supply,
Bob persuaded her to empty the tray and let
her try to carry it. Before Bob had taken
three steps the tray toppled, slipped, and
banged down hard on her toes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; she said, as she picked it up,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t live in a country where you
have to carry things this way. Suppose that
tray had been full of eggs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you lived here,&rdquo; sniffed Babe, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
have to learn on sugar-cane. You wouldn&rsquo;t
get a chance at eggs till you could carry sticks
of sugar-cane without ever dropping one of
them. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Martha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; said Martha, shuffling off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>grinning at the strange doings of &ldquo;them
gals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t discover
Martha until long after their first visit to
Grant&rsquo;s Town. What interested them most
on that trip were the gardens and the pickaninnies.
The latter, quickly perceiving that
the party was well supplied with pennies, appeared
in hordes as if by magic, and followed
the white folks all through the colored town,
not begging except with their great eyes,
which looked so wistful that the girls invented
all sorts of excuses for bestowing half-pennies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is prettier up here than down where we
are,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wales before they had gone
far. &ldquo;The soil must be richer away from the
sea. Look at those palms! And see the roses
around that little tumbled-down cabin! Do
you suppose I could buy some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as she spoke a pretty mulatto woman
appeared around the corner of the house, and,
saying that she was willing to sell her flowers,
picked Mrs. Wales a lovely bunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Wales, hoping
that she had not been too extravagant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman looked critically at the roses.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout threepence,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>

<p>The girls fairly gasped. To think of buying
a dozen roses and quantities of buds for
threepence&mdash;which is the same as six American
pennies. Then they began to order roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had as many roses as I wanted
in my whole life,&rdquo; said Roberta, &ldquo;and now
I&rsquo;m going to. I shall come up here every
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently they turned off the main road
into a grassy by-path, and came all at once
upon a small orange grove, whose trees were
loaded down with great clusters of golden
fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; shrieked with joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they&rsquo;ll let us pick a few,
father?&rdquo; asked Betty. &ldquo;We promised Rachel
and K. and Nita that we&rsquo;d bring them some
oranges we had picked ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better wait and come back
later in the week?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wales with a
twinkle. &ldquo;Ripe oranges don&rsquo;t keep long,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we may not have time to come back,&rdquo;
protested Betty. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll keep. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>anyhow, father, we are just crazy to pick some
now, aren&rsquo;t we, girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&ldquo; said Mr. Wales, laughing
heartily as he went off toward the nearest
house. He came back after a minute with
the owner of the grove, who invited the party
in and told them to pick as many oranges as
they wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take some grapefruit, too,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
some forbidden fruit. They&rsquo;re a good deal the
same, but you&rsquo;ll want to try everything while
you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we do,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;What other
kinds are there?&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sugar apples,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and sour
sops, and shaddock. I don&rsquo;t raise any of
those, but you can buy them at the market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll remember all those names,
Helen Chase Adams,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;As long as
you came to improve your mind, you might
as well do the remembering for the crowd.
Let&rsquo;s go to market to-morrow, girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; objected Helen. &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s
Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easter Sunday,&rdquo; added Madeline. &ldquo;Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>you suppose anybody will wear Easter hats to
church?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they know when to get
new clothes down here,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t any winter, and so of course there isn&rsquo;t
any spring. I suppose they just have to wait
until things wear out, and then get some more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a sensible way of doing, I should
say,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Wales.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to-morrow were Christmas, instead
of Easter,&rdquo; remarked Roberta irrelevantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish that, my dear?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Wales, who was always interested in
Roberta&rsquo;s odd fancies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Roberta, &ldquo;if to-morrow were
Christmas, we could have a Christmas tree,
and an orange tree would make such a fascinating
one, with all the oranges for decorations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t cut one down and take it
to the hotel, Roberta,&rdquo; objected Helen, the
matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Roberta, &ldquo;but we wouldn&rsquo;t have
to. There is a dear little orange tree with ten
oranges on it in the yard behind the annex.
I can see it from my window. The oranges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>look rather green, but still it would do beautifully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not have an Easter tree?&rdquo; asked
Madeline. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really just about as sensible
as having one at Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wait and have it on Easter
Monday,&rdquo; put in Babe. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get
ready for it to-day, and to-morrow we&rsquo;re going
to the Cathedral in the morning and to the
colored church in the afternoon. Besides, we
could have more fun with it on a week-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday is all right, but how about the
presents?&rdquo; inquired Bob practically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me attend to that,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Wales. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve picked up a few odds and ends
among the islands that will be just the thing
for an Easter tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to help a little,&rdquo; put in Eleanor.
She had heard Betty admiring a turtle with a
polished back, that hung in a shop-window on
Bay Street, and this would be a graceful way
of giving it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody may help who wants to,&rdquo; decreed
Mary, who, in her capacity of president and
senior member of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts,&rdquo; had
fallen into the habit of deciding such matters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>&ldquo;but no one must feel that she has to put anything
on the tree, because we all contribute
by just being down here, and that&rsquo;s a pretty
expensive contribution for most of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be fun!&rdquo; cried Babe enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Roberta must be mistress of ceremonies,
and arrange the presents. Let&rsquo;s have
it the first thing Monday morning. Seems as
if I couldn&rsquo;t wait a whole day and a half to
see it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; spent Saturday afternoon
shopping in small and mysterious parties
of ones and twos. No one but Eleanor had
much money to spend, and Eleanor felt that
it would not be in good taste for her to spend
much, except for Betty&rsquo;s tortoise. But all the
trifles added together made almost an embarrassment
of riches for the mistress of ceremonies,
who, as soon as Monday&rsquo;s breakfast was
over, ordered them piled on the ground near
the Easter tree, and then banished everybody
but Madeline from the back-yard.</p>

<p>When the tree was ready there was another
brief delay because Mr. and Mrs. Wales had
not arrived. But they came in a few minutes,
and Dr. Eaton was with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have let me know about this
function sooner, Miss Brooks,&rdquo; he began reproachfully.
&ldquo;I rushed around wildly in the
few minutes that I had after Mr. Wales invited
me to be present, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to get
very much.&rdquo; He held out a bulky parcel to
Roberta. &ldquo;The nine things that are all alike
are for you young ladies, and the two odd ones
are for Mrs. Wales and the chaperon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The things all alike&rdquo; proved to be nine
funny little &ldquo;finger-sponges,&rdquo; like those that
the girls afterward saw growing in the sea-gardens
of the bay, and the &ldquo;two odd ones&rdquo;
were bits of the dainty drawn-work that the
Nassau women do so beautifully. Roberta
decided that all the presents should be put on
the tree without wrappings, and the result was
decidedly original and fantastic. Betty&rsquo;s turtle
clung to one bough; Babbie&rsquo;s, presented to her
by the other two B&rsquo;s, was climbing the trunk.
Gay necklaces from Jamaica encircled the
smaller branches; shell-combs and pins, native-woven
baskets, post-cards with Nassau or Cuban
views, drawn-work handkerchiefs and collars,
shells, corals, and other strange spoils of the
sea&mdash;not to mention the oranges and a bunch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>of bananas for Eleanor, who declared she had
never yet had as many of them as she wanted,
as well as a bunch of roses for Roberta,&mdash;made
the Easter tree look very festive indeed.
Mr. and Mrs. Wales had provided something
for everybody, including Dr. Eaton, who entered
thoroughly into the spirit of the occasion
and seemed to enjoy the fun and frolic
quite as much as anybody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to propose a vote of
thanks to Miss Lewis for originating the
Easter tree,&rdquo; he said, when all the presents
had been distributed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; interposed Roberta
hastily. &ldquo;It was Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You began it,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;and it certainly
has been a lot of fun. Can&rsquo;t some of
you think of another Easter celebration to
take up the rest of the morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody considered for a moment, and
Bob had the first inspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to have an Easter egg-rolling,&ldquo;
she said. &ldquo;Our terrace here is a lot
nicer place than the one they use in Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t dye the eggs,&rdquo; said Helen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hot that the colors would run. I remember
I dyed a dress once at home in
August and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have oranges instead of eggs,&rdquo; interrupted
Mary. &ldquo;They are bright enough without
being dyed, and we can have a whole lot, for
they cost only six cents a dozen. Roberta
and I asked at the market this morning on our
way to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where will you get your children?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Wales, laughing at the girls&rsquo; enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Grant&rsquo;s Town, of course!&rdquo; shrieked
everybody at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those little black boys will be too cunning
for words,&rdquo; said Madeline, jumping up.
&ldquo;Somebody else go for the oranges, and Mary
and I will find the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; said Miss Hale, rising
also. &ldquo;Wait a minute while I get my sun-shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go too,&rdquo; said Dr. Eaton. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like the idea of you ladies wandering about
in Grant&rsquo;s Town alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel flushed and murmured something
about its being perfectly safe, though when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Mrs. Wales said doubtfully, &ldquo;Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t
quite, dear,&rdquo; she submitted. But she managed
to start off with Madeline, leaving Dr.
Eaton to console himself as best he could with
Mary&rsquo;s lively company.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Wales, Eleanor and Betty,
went after more oranges, and the rest sat on
the piazza, admiring their Easter presents and
discussing the egg-rolling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the children will care about
the oranges?&rdquo; asked Helen, doubtfully.
&ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;re even commoner here than
apples are with us.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Bob, dubiously. &ldquo;Perhaps
they won&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re worth scrambling
for.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what we can do,&rdquo; said Babbie,
after a minute&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;We can put coppers
inside. Then they&rsquo;ll go for them fast enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case we shall have to get some
more money changed,&rdquo; said Babe. &ldquo;Come
on down to the book-store. The man there is
awfully obliging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The various foraging parties returned at
about the same time, Betty, Eleanor and Mrs.
Wales loaded down with huge bags of oranges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>the B&rsquo;s bringing coppers galore, and Mary and
Madeline convoying ten small, ragged, and
rather frightened black urchins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are Eaton and Ethel?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Wales, counting up his party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be right along, I think, Mr.
Wales,&rdquo; answered Mary, sweetly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
believe we&rsquo;d better wait for them, do you?
These boys didn&rsquo;t really want to come, and
I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll run away if we don&rsquo;t hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babbie explained her scheme for adding
excitement to the orange-rolling, and there
was no doubt of its efficiency. The instant
that Mr. Wales began making slits in the
rinds of the oranges, so that the girls could
poke pennies or half-pennies down the holes,
the ten small boys became suddenly rigid
with attention. They had come reluctantly,
not exactly knowing what to expect, but when
there was a prospect of coppers they became
eagerness personified.</p>

<p>When all the oranges had been duly
&ldquo;stuffed,&rdquo; the boys were stationed at the foot
of the steep terrace, and the girls started five
or six big oranges rolling down toward them.
For an instant the ten hesitated, then they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>plunged wildly up the slope to capture the
spoils. As each succeeded in getting an
orange, he retreated to the foot of the hill,
and began a frantic effort to eat down to his
penny before any more oranges were started
down the slope. One crafty but too confiding
youth decided to pile his booty at the foot of
the hill, hoping thus to gain time and distance
his fellows. But while his back was turned,
the pile disappeared. Another tried dropping
the fruit into his blouse, but in the scramble
several oranges fell out. The only safe way
was to get the penny out as soon as you had
secured the orange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they&rsquo;ll die of indigestion?&rdquo;
gasped Mrs. Wales, breathless with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or be poisoned from those dirty pennies?&rdquo;
suggested Eleanor, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales, cheerfully.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine their digestions are delicate,
and you remember that the divers all kept
their winnings in their mouths, so I don&rsquo;t believe
you need worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All too soon the supply of oranges was exhausted
and the tattered regiment departed,
fairly wreathed in smiles, to buy sugar-cane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>and gloat over their friends who had not spent
the morning so profitably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that too lovely?&rdquo; sighed Mary, as
the girls collected the remains of the orange-rolling
into a basket for the gardener to throw
away. &ldquo;I saw a moving picture once of two
little pickaninnies racing to see which could
finish his slice of watermelon first. But they
didn&rsquo;t begin to eat so fast or look so funny as
our boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as she had finished speaking, Dr. Eaton
and Miss Hale appeared around the corner of
the house. He was carrying her parasol, and
they were walking slowly and laughing and
chatting in a very friendly fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we ought to have saved some of the
oranges until you came,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wales,
when she saw them, &ldquo;but the boys were so
impatient,&mdash;and to tell the truth I&rsquo;m afraid
we forgot all about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loiterers mustn&rsquo;t expect to have their
cake and eat it too,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales, beaming
benignly upon the two laggards.</p>

<p>Ethel looked reproachfully at Mary.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wait for us?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;We were trying to persuade that funny little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>boy, at the thatched cottage with the breadfruit
tree in front of it, to come with us.
And all at once we noticed that you were
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;We were sorry, but
the ten we had wouldn&rsquo;t wait. They were
going to strike if they couldn&rsquo;t move on at
once. Didn&rsquo;t you get the funny little one to
come after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;he positively refused.
I was so hot that I had to rest for a minute,
and then we came back, but not very
straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not straight at all,&rdquo; corrected Dr. Eaton
smilingly. &ldquo;We got badly lost. You see I&rsquo;d
never been up there before, and when you
abandoned us I got completely turned around.
I&rsquo;m sorry I was so stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it didn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Ethel hastily.
&ldquo;But where are the boys? Isn&rsquo;t it time to begin
the orange-rolling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ethel,&rdquo; exclaimed Betty in dismay.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you understand? The boys were in
a hurry, and we had it right off. It lasted a
long while though, and they&rsquo;ve been gone almost
ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll get some more boys and have
another rolling just for you two,&rdquo; declared
Bob gallantly.</p>

<p>Ethel bestowed a searching glance upon
Dr. Eaton. &ldquo;We must have gone farther
out of our way than I thought,&rdquo; she said
frigidly.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, feeling the interested
eyes of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; fastened upon
her, she began to blush, just exactly as Betty
Wales or Babbie would have blushed under a
similar embarrassment, and picking up her
parasol she hurried off into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; did not know exactly
how to interpret this incident. Its immediate
effect was to make the relations between
Ethel and Dr. Eaton a shade less cordial
than before. But, as Mary said, you
couldn&rsquo;t judge by appearances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t deliberately run away from
them,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;You see our ten
boys began chasing a dog down a side street,
and of course we had to chase the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they couldn&rsquo;t possibly have caught up
with us,&rdquo; put in Madeline, &ldquo;but that doesn&rsquo;t
account for their coming in at the finish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>three large quarters of an hour behind
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you think they happened to
do it?&rdquo; inquired Babe scientifically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; returned Mary, &ldquo;that they were
having an awfully jolly little talk, and that
they forgot the passing of time&mdash;or at least
Miss Hale did&mdash;and the rules for the dignity
of chaperons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Babbie, &ldquo;she forgot she was a
faculty and acted just like any other girl.
She isn&rsquo;t old; she&rsquo;s just at the nicest age. And
isn&rsquo;t she dear when she blushes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always dear,&rdquo; declared Eleanor, remembering
her freshman year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; began little Helen
Adams anxiously, &ldquo;that people generally forget
the time until after they&rsquo;ve begun to know
each other awfully well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at Helen&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know about such things, my
child?&rdquo; asked Mary loftily. &ldquo;Did you ever
go to walk with a man and get lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered Helen simply. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know any men. But I have noticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve had a week.&rdquo; Mary smiled
reminiscently. &ldquo;You can do a lot in a week,&rdquo;
she announced with a finality that closed the
discussion.</p>

<small><small>A RÔLE FOR THE HERO</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;The</span> trouble with this novel,&rdquo; said Mary
Brooks, &ldquo;is that the hero can&rsquo;t seem to get
any chance.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The girls were sitting on the Colonial&rsquo;s
piazza after breakfast, their chairs drawn into
a confidential circle in a retired nook close to
the water&rsquo;s edge. Farther back Mr. and Mrs.
Wales and Miss Hale were talking with a
family of Spanish-Americans that Mr. and
Mrs. Wales had met at almost every stop they
had made in their West Indian cruise. Dr.
Eaton was playing clock-golf on the lawn with
a group of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Madeline, watching him critically,
as he made a brilliant putt into the cup
from the very edge of the green, &ldquo;I should
say that the trouble is not with the novel, but
with the hero. He has had plenty of chances,
but he doesn&rsquo;t use them. In plain terms, he
isn&rsquo;t much of a hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think he&rsquo;s slow myself,&rdquo;
declared Bob Parker. &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s father helps
him along a lot. He asks him to all our
parties, and fairly throws Miss Hale at his
head, and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; interrupted Mary severely, &ldquo;please
speak more respectfully of Betty&rsquo;s father.
You&rsquo;re making him out a very peculiar person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean well enough,&rdquo;
returned Bob calmly. &ldquo;I mean that he tries
to make things pleasant for everybody, and
of course Miss Hale and Dr. Eaton are the
natural ones to be paired off together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Mary approvingly.
&ldquo;Yes, I know what you mean, and I admit
that Mr. Wales is a merry match-maker with
a vengeance, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary,&rdquo; interposed Betty hastily, &ldquo;he
doesn&rsquo;t know a thing about that. I should
never dare mention it to him or mother. I&rsquo;m
afraid they wouldn&rsquo;t think it was exactly&mdash;nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean to imply that it was
intentional assistance he was giving us,&rdquo; explained
Mary, &ldquo;but the effect is just the same.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>He&rsquo;s been a noble ally, but it wasn&rsquo;t that kind
of chances&mdash;chances to talk society small talk
with the heroine, or to walk and sail with
her, and so on,&mdash;that I was thinking of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry and tell us what you were
thinking of, then,&rdquo; demanded Bob impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mary began with provoking slowness,
&ldquo;I was thinking of heroic chances. A
hero isn&rsquo;t a hero because he makes love well.
The heroine tolerates his love-making because
he&rsquo;s a hero. But somehow down here there&rsquo;s
no chance to be up and doing. If it was
only South America, now, and if there was
a revolution brewing, and Dr. Eaton should
save some of our lives, or get an army together
and be elected president or king or whatever
the people wanted to elect&mdash;why, then of
course Miss Hale would admire him tremendously,
and the novel would spin along like
a top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s a good deal in that, Mary,&rdquo;
declared Bob. &ldquo;Stories that don&rsquo;t have any
adventures in them are always about stupid
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;we must be stupid
people, for we haven&rsquo;t had anything yet that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>can be called an adventure, and in two days
we sail for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had an awfully good time though,&rdquo;
amended Eleanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Helen Chase Adams has improved
her mind a lot,&rdquo; added Babe, &ldquo;and she has
also improved the way she does up her hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;I shall always
regret it if the merry match-making part falls
through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Madeline gravely, &ldquo;it is clearly
our duty to save President Brooks&rsquo;s feelings.
Who will volunteer to throw herself in front
of one of these crazy Nassau horses, or to fall
from the lookout at Fort Charlotte, or tumble
down the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase behind Fort Fincastle,
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump into the swimming-pool,&rdquo; suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or off the yacht,&rdquo; added Eleanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or get lost at night up in Grant&rsquo;s Town,&rdquo;
put in Babbie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; interrupted Madeline severely.
&ldquo;You get the idea. Now, who will
be the victim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose the hero didn&rsquo;t come and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>rescue you?&rdquo; suggested Helen. &ldquo;Besides,
isn&rsquo;t it the heroine that the hero always
rescues?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, generally it is,&rdquo; admitted Madeline,
&ldquo;but in this case I think any one of us would
do beautifully. A chaperon would have to
be extremely grateful to anybody who saved
the life of one of her young charges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline yawned ostentatiously. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;let us elect President Brooks to the
office of first victim-in-waiting to the hero.
All in favor say aye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; shouted everybody promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to have elected Betty,&rdquo;
objected Mary. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always getting into
fixes, whereas I never do; and if I begin now
it will look like a put-up job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty blushed guiltily. &ldquo;I am always having
mishaps,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had one this
morning. I wasn&rsquo;t going to tell about it, but
it would have been a perfectly fine chance for
a hero if he&rsquo;d been there. But he wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell us about it,&rdquo; demanded Mary.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you do the same thing over again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Betty indignantly.
&ldquo;It was this way. You know I came down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>early to breakfast, to help mother into her
dress that buttons up the back. Well, I was
hurrying down the hill on Market Street,
thinking how sorry I should be to leave this
funny little place, and all of a sudden I heard
a bicycle bell behind me. It startled me
dreadfully and I began to go to the right; but
then I remembered that you must pass to the
left here, so I changed and went to the left,
and the result was that we both landed in the
middle of the road on top of each other.
That is, the man and the wheel went over
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Roberta. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t
you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very much, but I was dreadfully
frightened, because the man groaned and
acted as if he was nearly dead,&mdash;he was a
negro, you understand,&mdash;and I was afraid he
would arrest me, before I could find father.
You see it was early and there weren&rsquo;t any
white people out, but there were a lot of negroes
and I thought they would take his part.
In the end they were awfully nice. A big
black man helped me up and scolded the man
on the wheel, and made him say he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>sorry, and then I walked home and brushed off
the dust and got a scolding from father for
being so heedless, and made him promise not
to tell you girls. But just for a few minutes
I should have been awfully glad to have a
hero come and rescue me. I suppose, though,
he was probably sound asleep,&rdquo; ended Betty
practically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always late to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which shows,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;that it is the
early hero who catches the girl. Just think
what a waste of a perfectly good adventure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow it proves that we&rsquo;re not in the
class with Bob&rsquo;s stupid people who never
have adventures!&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
a great relief. Here comes Miss Hale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Ethel, hurrying up to the
group, &ldquo;have you any plan for this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but to sit around here until it&rsquo;s
time to have a bath in the swimming-pool,&rdquo;
answered Betty. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m sure that we
should all like to do whatever you&rsquo;ve
thought of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These friends of your father&rsquo;s have been
telling us about another bathing-place,&rdquo; ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>plained
Ethel, &ldquo;out on the surf-side of Hog
Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the little island out in the harbor,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>

<p>Ethel nodded. &ldquo;The man who owns it
runs boats back and forth across the bay all
through the morning. He has a fruit orchard
out there too, where you can stop to rest and
eat all the fruit you want after your bath.
These people say it&rsquo;s great fun to go over
there, and the nicest part of all is that it
only costs twenty-five cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat trips and fruit and all?&rdquo; asked
Eleanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat trips and fruit and all,&rdquo; repeated
Ethel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we all want to go,&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to go home feeling that we
have missed anything&mdash;particularly something
that only costs a quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we start right off?&rdquo; asked Babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just as you please,&rdquo; said Ethel,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s quite a walk to the Hog Island
landing, and we might have to wait a few
minutes for a boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then by all means let&rsquo;s go now,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>Babe, rising energetically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so
much about the surf bathing, but it seems as
if I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get to the fruit orchard
part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the bathing contingent hurried down to
the Casino to get their suits; those who did
not care to go into the surf collected books
and fancy-work to help them while away the
morning under the trees in the orange grove,
and presently the party, which as a matter-of-course
included Dr. Eaton, was wending its
way to the wharf.</p>

<p>During the short row to the island, Babe
interrogated the boatman as to the exact
amount of fruit that was included in the
quarter&rsquo;s toll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All you lak,&rdquo; said the big black fellow
with a grin. &ldquo;One man he eat forty oranges,
and some they stay over all day and git thar
dinner and thar supper. Don&rsquo;t you worry
&rsquo;bout that, missy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Babe, with a sigh of satisfaction.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I shall have to pay
extra. Just imagine eating forty oranges in
one day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun was very hot on the water, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>was a great relief to get into the shade of the
tamarind and almond trees that lined the
trail across Hog Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Babbie, when they had
reached the other side. &ldquo;The bathing-houses
are right out in the boiling sun, and the
white beach looks sizzling hot. I&rsquo;m going to
stay here with Mrs. Wales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay with her, too,&rdquo; said
Roberta. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even bring my bathing
things, because I knew it would be too hot
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about all those thin dresses that I
made you pack?&rdquo; jeered Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they were thinner,&rdquo; sighed Roberta,
who hated dreadfully to be either too hot or
too cold.</p>

<p>But in spite of the blinding glare of the sun
on the white sand, the rest persisted in their
intention of having a bath in the surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be so bad as it looks from here,&rdquo;
said Helen, &ldquo;or all those people who are in
bathing couldn&rsquo;t stand it. They seem to be
having a grand time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water must be a little cool anyhow,&rdquo;
added Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And it will be such fun tumbling around
in those big waves,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose that I can practice swimming though,
can I, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, perhaps you can,&rdquo; said Mr. Wales,
carelessly. &ldquo;That surf isn&rsquo;t very strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I can&rsquo;t, I shall take another bath
in the swimming-pool this afternoon,&rdquo; declared
Betty. &ldquo;I am bound to learn to swim
a little before I leave Nassau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise not to begin to eat until we come
back,&rdquo; called Babe over her shoulder to the
three who had stayed behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; they shouted back, and Babe,
reassured that no one would begin until she
did, hurried after the rest up the sunny slope
to the bath-houses. There was a breeze up
there and down on the sand, that wasn&rsquo;t
blowing in the grove; and the water was cool,
though not cool enough to be very invigorating.
So nobody cared to stay in long,&mdash;at
least nobody but Betty, who found that she
could practice swimming almost as well here
as in the still pool at the Casino.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost got it,&rdquo; she explained to Dr.
Eaton, who was an expert swimmer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>had been trying to show her the stroke. &ldquo;I
can stay up as long as I like, but I stay in one
place. I can&rsquo;t go ahead any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get that,&rdquo; said Dr. Eaton,
swimming off into deep water. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
shallow where you are,&rdquo; he called as he swam.
&ldquo;Try it out a little further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Betty, being perfectly fearless, tried,
with such success that she did not notice for
some time that Mr. Wales, Ethel, and the
girls had all gone in, and that the beach was
for the moment clear of other bathers except
Dr. Eaton, who had waded to shore very much
further down and stood there examining a
shell that he had picked up in the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to swim in from here just once
more,&rdquo; thought Betty, wading out to where
the water was almost up to her arm-pits.
&ldquo;Madeline has been ready to catch me before,
but she hasn&rsquo;t had to. I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But somehow Madeline&rsquo;s not being there,
ready to help if she was needed, did make a
difference. All of a sudden, while she was
still in fairly deep water, Betty realized that
she was alone and afraid. She lost the stroke
and went under. Struggling to get her foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ing
she was knocked flat again by an unusually
big wave. The water surged and gurgled
over her, she tried again to get up, and again
fell back, faint and almost exhausted. But
she would not give up! To die like this in
five feet of water! She tried to cry out, but
the waves drowned her voice. And then she
stopped trying to get her footing. She was
too tired to struggle any longer or to notice
when something splashed along beside her.
She thought it was only another big dark
wave coming at her until a strong arm pulled
her up into the air and sunshine, and a laughing
voice asked her if she was all right now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; gasped Betty, coughing and
trying to wipe her eyes on the dripping sleeve
of her bathing-suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you walk in to shore, or shall I carry
you?&rdquo; inquired the voice anxiously, and for
the first time Betty perceived that it was Dr.
Eaton who had come to her rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can walk all right. I&rsquo;m only&mdash;out
of breath,&rdquo; said Betty, waving her hand reassuringly
to a confused group of people, headed
by Miss Hale, who were running down the
beach toward her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky I saw you just when I did,&rdquo; said
Dr. Eaton, soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry you
had such a fright, Miss Wales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was nothing,&rdquo; said Betty, easily,
wading slowly in toward the shore, &ldquo;only it
is unpleasant to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Ethel, don&rsquo;t look
like that. Please, please don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m not hurt
one bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Hale was as white as the sand that
gleamed under her feet. &ldquo;Oh, Betty, Betty
Wales,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you frightened us all so!&rdquo;
Her voice broke into a little sob. &ldquo;You were
under my charge, too. I should have had to
tell your mother that I&rsquo;d let you&mdash;let you
drown.&rdquo; She turned to Dr. Eaton. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
thank you enough, John.&rdquo; She held out her
hand and Dr. Eaton shook it gravely. Then
Ethel turned without a word, and ran up the
steps to the bath-house, and after a moment
Dr. Eaton followed.</p>

<p>Betty turned with an hysterical little laugh
to the girls who were hovering anxiously
about her. &ldquo;Well, Mary Brooks, I hope
you&rsquo;re satisfied,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I hope you realize
that I&rsquo;ve given your hero a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary stared in astonishment, and then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>suddenly comprehending, as she thought, she
smiled her most beamish smile. &ldquo;You little
fraud,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You mean you did it on
purpose? How did you ever manage it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it on purpose!&rdquo; repeated Betty indignantly.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d ever been nearly drowned,
I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t care to do it again on
purpose, Mary Brooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was beautifully apropos, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
laughed Madeline. &ldquo;Did you remember anything
about our talk this morning, while you
were waiting for the hero to sprint down the
beach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I was too
busy trying to scramble up to think of anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think of all your past life?&rdquo;
inquired Babe, solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Babe, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you
came as near being drowned as it looked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Betty, wearily, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m awfully, awfully tired now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eleanor and Mary flew to help her up to
the house, reproaching themselves with not
having hurried her in to rest sooner. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>the procession of bedraggled figures took its
way up the path, Helen Chase Adams made
an astonishing announcement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she began in awed, wondering
tones. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t any of you notice? She called
him John. Miss Hale called Dr. Eaton that,
I mean, just now when she thanked him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; asked Betty, absently. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Babe, eagerly, &ldquo;she did. I remember
now. I was so frightened about you
at the time that I hardly heard, but she certainly
said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you enough, John.&rsquo;
How do you suppose she happened to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procession halted to consider the matter.
&ldquo;She was awfully rattled,&rdquo; suggested
Bob. &ldquo;Perhaps it was just a slip of the
tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it was a slip of the
tongue,&rdquo; agreed Mary, scornfully, &ldquo;but just
the same it shows how fast they&rsquo;ve been getting
on, when we thought they weren&rsquo;t getting
on at all. It&rsquo;s amazing! You don&rsquo;t
know how relieved I am, Betty. I don&rsquo;t believe
we shall have to worry one bit more
about the merry match-making.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Miss Hale knows what she
said,&rdquo; Madeline speculated, as they went on
up the steps. &ldquo;If they have got to the calling-each-other-by-the-first-name
stage so soon, it
must be that they&rsquo;ve been acting formal and
offish to deceive us and put us off the scent.
But after this they must see that it won&rsquo;t be
much use to pretend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be careful, girls, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
begged Betty. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t stare at them or&mdash;or&mdash;act
too interested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Mary promised solemnly. &ldquo;We
shall be completely absorbed in you. Besides,
it would be against all the rules for
good match-making.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But down in the orange grove, in spite of
the excitement over Betty&rsquo;s narrow escape
and the counter attraction of a banana-eating
contest between Bob and Eleanor, it was impossible
for any of the nine girls to keep their
eyes turned resolutely away from Ethel and
Dr. Eaton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, but isn&rsquo;t he devoted!&rdquo; whispered Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t even trying to pretend,&rdquo; declared
Helen softly. &ldquo;I think the pretending
was Miss Hale&rsquo;s idea. I&rsquo;m positive he&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>wanted to be devoted before, only she
wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now she likes it as well as he does,&rdquo;
added Madeline. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t even thinking
of blushing and running away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which proves that all the hero needed was
a chance,&rdquo; murmured Mary Brooks, proud of
her discernment.</p>

<p>Roberta sat down beside Betty, bringing her
a glass of cocoanut &ldquo;milk&rdquo; to taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you pleased about the novel?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it comical?&rdquo; laughed Betty. &ldquo;I was
the one that didn&rsquo;t believe in the novel, as
you call it, and now I seem to be the one who
has helped it along. But just the same, Roberta,&mdash;don&rsquo;t
tell Mary, because I can&rsquo;t argue
the way she can,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m perfectly sure that
all Mary&rsquo;s scheming hasn&rsquo;t had a thing to do
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has then?&rdquo; demanded Roberta incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;only I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s all a lot more complicated than Mary and
the rest of you think. In novels people may
fall in love that way, but not in real life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Roberta considered for a moment. &ldquo;Well,
anyhow it will make a beautiful story,&rdquo; she
declared at last. &ldquo;Mary is going to write it
on the steamer, and we are going to illustrate
it with the pictures we&rsquo;ve taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a grand idea!&rdquo; cried Betty, jumping
up as briskly as if she had not just
escaped drowning. &ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s go and
try all the queer fruit before somebody says
that it&rsquo;s time to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> end of the Nassau visit had come at
last, much too soon to suit Betty Wales and the
rest of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything lovely always ends so soon,&rdquo;
Betty lamented, as she stood by the deck-railing
between Madeline and Mary Brooks
and looked back across the shimmering bay to
catch a last glimpse of the sunny little city,
half hidden in its circle of tall palms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so do horrid things end,&rdquo; announced
Madeline philosophically. &ldquo;Everything ends,
and how dull life would be if it didn&rsquo;t. Besides,
we&rsquo;re going back to spring term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Betty. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my one
comfort. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it to jump away
back into winter again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And some time we&rsquo;re all coming back to
Nassau,&rdquo; added Mary Brooks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Betty absently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, because we drank out of Blackbeard&rsquo;s
Well. If you do that you are perfectly
sure to come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that the reason you made me drink
that horrid water this morning?&rdquo; laughed
Betty. &ldquo;I went up-stairs to get something
that mother had forgotten, and when I came
back you were all down in a corner of the
garden drinking that warm, sickish water; but
I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea why you were doing it.
Who was Blackbeard, and why does drinking
out of his well make you sure to come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
some sort of a spell, I suppose. Your father
heard about it and told us. Blackbeard was
a pirate who buried his treasure here and
watered his ships at that spring. He must
have been Bluebeard&rsquo;s cousin, because Dr.
Eaton said he had fourteen wives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo; sighed Betty. &ldquo;Well, I
only hope that the spell will work. And now
I must go down-stairs this minute to see if I
can do anything for Ethel or Roberta. I suppose
they&rsquo;re getting ready to be seasick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleanor Watson has gone,&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;How that girl has changed, Betty. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>never used to be happy unless she was at the
centre of the stage, and now she&rsquo;s as retiring
as Helen Chase Adams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That reminds me!&rdquo; announced Madeline
oracularly, and went off in pursuit of the B&rsquo;s,
who were seldom far apart.</p>

<p>But to her disappointment the B&rsquo;s frowned
upon her plan to hold a &ldquo;Merry Heart&rdquo;
meeting on shipboard and elect Eleanor
Watson to membership.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to be nice to her,&rdquo; declared
Bob, &ldquo;but I think that&rsquo;s enough, for now, any
way. She&rsquo;s been a brick on this trip and I&rsquo;m
glad she came, on her own account as well as
on Betty&rsquo;s. But I hate cheats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a person has done a thing like that
you can&rsquo;t ever really trust her,&rdquo; added Babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; concluded Babbie, who, being
very tender-hearted, would have yielded but
for the support of the other two members of
the triumvirate, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to be known
as her very particular friend, and &lsquo;The Merry
Hearts&rsquo; are all very particular friends, Madeline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Madeline pleasantly. &ldquo;I
only wanted to find out how you felt. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>would be a risk, I know, to take her in. I
suppose I&rsquo;m a risky person. Just consider
that the matter hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; promised Babe, and Madeline
strolled back to Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary has gone to begin the novel,&rdquo; Betty
told her. &ldquo;She wants to get as much done as
possible before Ethel comes on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; remarked Madeline, irrelevantly,
&ldquo;that if it wasn&rsquo;t a lot more trouble
to find things than to lose them people would
be even more careless than they are now. But
it seems a little hard sometimes to have to
hunt so many months for a thing you lost in
a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty stared at her uncomprehendingly.
&ldquo;What kind of things do you mean, Madeline?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all sorts,&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Handkerchiefs
and fountain pens and gold beads and
reputations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The novel was the chief excitement during
the stormy voyage home. It was to be a sort
of log-book of the journey, with the merry
match-making for its main theme. Mary
Brooks, because of her habit of utilizing local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>happenings to advantage in her themes, had
been &ldquo;elected&rdquo; to write it, the camera fiends
were to furnish the illustrations, and the rest
were to give suggestions and act as advisory
committee.</p>

<p>Fortunately Mary belonged to the small
minority of the ship&rsquo;s passengers who were
not seasick, and she amused herself and
everybody else in the party but Ethel with
the chapters of the novel, or novelette as she
modestly called it. She found her audience
interested, but extremely critical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never be an authoress,&rdquo; she declared
firmly on the last afternoon of the voyage,
when most of the invalids had come on
deck and sat about warmly wrapped in rugs
and golf capes. &ldquo;I had thought of devoting
myself to literature next year, but I&rsquo;ve changed
my mind. The general public is too hard to
suit, if you are fair samples. Roberta thinks
I have too much description of Nassau, and
now Betty thinks I haven&rsquo;t enough. Bob
says the conversation sounds stilted, and yesterday
Helen Adams told me that it wasn&rsquo;t
high-flown enough for college faculty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to be guided by the dic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>tates
of your own inborn genius,&rdquo; said Babbie,
grandiloquently. &ldquo;An &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; editor ought
to know how to write a story without asking
advice from all her &lsquo;young friends,&rsquo; Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you in the name of the &lsquo;Argus&rsquo;
editors,&rdquo; murmured Mary, recalling a scathing
comment to the same effect that Dr. Hinsdale
had put on her last psychology report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; said Helen Adams, tumbling
into the conversation in her funny abrupt
fashion, &ldquo;somehow&mdash;Mary&rsquo;s story is interesting&mdash;but
it does sound awfully made up.
You would never guess it had really happened,
would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I am a romanticist,&rdquo; said
Mary, calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you little
juniors know anything about romanticists, so
I will explain that they are the kind of novelists
who use their imaginations. In this case
I really had to depend on my imagination
because naturally I wasn&rsquo;t there when the
most exciting things happened. But when I
have been there under somewhat similar circumstances,&rdquo;
added Mary, with a meaning
smile, &ldquo;this was about the way things went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chapter about Betty&rsquo;s drowning is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>worst of all,&rdquo; declared Bob, &ldquo;and it ought to
be the best. It seemed exciting enough at the
time, but when you think it over there&rsquo;s nothing
to it. Betty ought to have been out in
water over her head, and Dr. Eaton ought to
have sunk once or twice trying to bring her
in, and really risked his life to save her.
Then it would sound like something, and
there would be some reason in the silly way
you made the heroine act afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Mary, doubtfully. &ldquo;It
would be a great deal more artistic that way.
Shall I change it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; objected Roberta. &ldquo;That would
spoil the whole idea of the novel&rsquo;s being true
and the merry match-making being ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, perhaps it will seem all right
when the pictures are put in,&rdquo; suggested
Mary, hopefully. &ldquo;Lots of novels wouldn&rsquo;t
amount to anything without the illustrations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Bob tell you what she thought of?&rdquo;
asked Babbie. &ldquo;She suggested that the novel
would make the best kind of wedding present
for Miss Hale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness no!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>not going to be a laughing-stock for the faculty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But think of all the tender memories it
would evoke,&rdquo; said Bob, grinning broadly at
her own sentimentality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how well it will prove that things are
not what they seem to the fine imagination of
a budding young authoress,&rdquo; added Madeline
Ayres, who had been conspicuously silent
during the discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Madeline?&rdquo; asked
Mary, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;that your novel
is a fairy-tale&mdash;every word of the match-making
part, except a few unimportant facts that
you saw but misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; cried Betty, in triumph.
&ldquo;Oh, Madeline, how did you find out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Madeline only shrugged her shoulders.
&ldquo;No matter how,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d
better warn them, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be
too much disappointed later on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that Dr. Eaton and Miss
Hale haven&rsquo;t fallen in love?&rdquo; demanded
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t go as far as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know any more about
it than Betty does. You&rsquo;re both guessing,&rdquo;
declared Mary indignantly.</p>

<p>Madeline smiled her slow, provoking smile.
&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; she said, and even to Betty
she confided little more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to
Dr. Eaton,&ldquo; she admitted. &ldquo;That is, I happened
to ask him one question, and you&rsquo;re
right, Betty. Mary&rsquo;s scheming was as much
use as most match-making is.</p>

<p>&rdquo;But the book will be a good wedding present
all the same,&rdquo; she assured Mary.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very ingenious fairy-tale, and I&rsquo;m
sure they&rsquo;ll enjoy seeing themselves as others
saw them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you suppose they will act when
they get back to Harding?&rdquo; Roberta wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll certainly make some bad breaks
if they try to deceive the girls,&rdquo; declared
Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mary warned them all, &ldquo;we
mustn&rsquo;t make any breaks. We must remember
that it&rsquo;s the business of the merry
match-makers not to breathe a word of what
we&rsquo;ve noticed, but to be very discreet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>dignified.&rdquo; Mary drew herself up proudly in
her steamer chair.</p>

<p>Everybody got down to the last dinner on
shipboard, even to Ethel, who came in leaning
on Mr. Wales&rsquo;s arm, and looking very
pale through her Nassau tan. To the surprise
of the match-makers she merely
nodded to Dr. Eaton, and his nod in return
was just as casual as hers. And the next
morning when he bade the girls good-bye on
the wharf,&mdash;for he was taking an early train
to Harding,&mdash;he shook hands with Ethel in
the same hearty, offhand way in which he
had just shaken hands with Eleanor, and did
not so much as try for a last word with the
heroine. It was astonishing and disappointing
enough!</p>

<p>Mr. Wales took the party in charge for the
afternoon, and they did New York with a
vengeance, but neither luncheon at the
Waldorf nor the marvels of the circus at
the Hippodrome sufficed to cheer Mary
Brooks, whose lively spirits were completely
dampened by the failure of her pet scheme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she sighed to Roberta, &ldquo;that
it&rsquo;s all gone for nothing&mdash;that mad dash that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>Madeline and I made home from Grant&rsquo;s
Town, when it&rsquo;s a wonder we didn&rsquo;t die of
sun-stroke, and Betty&rsquo;s drowning, and the
novel, and all the films that Eleanor and
Roberta wasted getting snap-shots of the hero
and heroine, not to mention the able assistance
of Mr. Wales. Betty, mayn&rsquo;t I ask your
father what he thinks now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Wales was as much in the dark as
the girls. &ldquo;I thought for a while that we had
it all fixed,&rdquo; he said with a twinkle, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m afraid Ethel was playing summer girl
down there in the tropics. I should like to
tell her what a fine fellow Eaton is, and give
her some good advice about marrying and
settling down before she&rsquo;s worn herself out
teaching troublesome young things like you,
but Mrs. Wales says I&rsquo;d better not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the way up to Harding nobody had
much time to devote to the subject of match-making.
The train was full of Harding
girls. Nita got on at the junction and
Katherine and Rachel were at the station
to greet the southern tourists. There were
regular volleys of questions to answer, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>was great fun telling all about the queer
things they had seen and done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t find out everything from the
guide-books, Katherine,&rdquo; Betty told her,
&ldquo;and you were wrong about the sidewalks.
They weren&rsquo;t narrow, because generally there
weren&rsquo;t any at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A day or two later the college discovered
where Dr. Eaton had spent his vacation, and
there were more questions: Had they seen
much of him? What was he like out of
class? How did he and Miss Hale get on
together?</p>

<p>The last question the girls parried as well
as they could. &ldquo;And I guess,&rdquo; said Mary,
&ldquo;that our different versions are about as
much alike as black and white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the novel and the illustrations
for it lay unheeded in the depths of Mary&rsquo;s
desk drawer, for the author declared that she
should not copy it into the beautiful gilt
edge, morocco-covered blank-book which the
club had provided until she knew exactly
how things were going to end. This there
seemed to be no immediate prospect of find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>ing
out. &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; watched Ethel
and Dr. Eaton as closely as they could without
appearing intrusive, but they discovered
absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She asked Betty to go walking with her
just as she always did,&rdquo; announced Babbie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he goes off horseback riding with
Professor Hinsdale,&rdquo; contributed Roberta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was right behind her when she and
Dr. Eaton met on the stairs yesterday morning,&rdquo;
added Helen, &ldquo;and they bowed and said
good-morning, just as they&rsquo;d have said it to
any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does look awfully happy though,&rdquo;
said Bob, who for a tom-boy had become
extremely interested in Ethel&rsquo;s romance.
&ldquo;When we were having a written lesson the
other day she sat there with her eyes just
shining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she always was happy enough,&rdquo; objected
matter-of-fact Helen. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
she be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty and Madeline exchanged glances.
They had never referred to the night when
they saw Ethel crying. But in any case her
good spirits were very easily explained; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Nassau trip had rested and cheered her up, and
that was all she needed.</p>

<p>And so, after two weeks of unrewarded observation,
&ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; forgot to speculate
about the interesting faculty romance&mdash;if
romance it was&mdash;and plunged whole-heartedly
into the gaieties of spring term. First and
foremost among them was of course the junior
&ldquo;prom.&rdquo; For weeks before vacation it had
been a topic of absorbing interest, and now
most of the juniors thought and talked
of little else. Helen Adams begrudged the
way the &ldquo;prom.&rdquo; monopolized attention, supplanting
all the impromptu festivities and
throwing the man-less dances in which she
delighted quite into the shade. One reason
why Helen loved college so was because there
were no men to bother about; but now for
two weeks man was the sole topic of conversation,
and to have a man, safe and sure, for the
&ldquo;prom.&rdquo; the desideratum of every junior.
But Helen Adams was a &ldquo;freak.&rdquo; Every
other girl in 19&mdash; reveled in the situation,
though some, like Katherine Kittredge, scoffed
unfeelingly at their friends&rsquo; predicaments, and
others, like Roberta Lewis, who had gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>courage to invite her cousin from Boston, were
filled with secret misgivings and devoutly
wished that their men would sprain their
ankles (not seriously), like Alice Waite&rsquo;s
tenth one, or be asked to go to Europe with a
rich uncle, like Rachel Morrison&rsquo;s brother.
For a &ldquo;prom.&rdquo; is a great responsibility as well
as a great joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you it&rsquo;s no laughing matter,&rdquo;
declared little Alice Waite, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve got
your dress and made out your program and
are just dying to go, to have the last man you
know east of Denver sprain his ankle&mdash;it&rsquo;s
heart-breaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost as bad as when you had two men
on your hands for the concert and Georgia
Ames couldn&rsquo;t help you out,&rdquo; jeered Katherine
Kittredge. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity that Georgia had
to miss the prom.? She&rsquo;d have been in her
element when her men disappeared into thin
air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody took Alice&rsquo;s troubles very seriously,
because Alice was always in trouble and out
again. But the whole class of 19&mdash; looked
sober when it was rumored that Rachel Morrison
was actually thinking of staying at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>home and letting the vice-president take her
place. For 19&mdash; was very proud of Rachel, and
besides a junior &ldquo;prom.&rdquo; without the junior
president would be Hamlet with Hamlet left
out. But Rachel couldn&rsquo;t be made to feel her
own importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get on with a strange man,&rdquo;
she declared, when various of her friends generously
offered their guests for the president&rsquo;s
use. &ldquo;Christy will lead the march a lot better
than I, and you must let her do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so 19&mdash; was duly grateful to Eleanor
Watson when she overruled all Rachel&rsquo;s objections,
after Betty and Nita had both tried to
and failed, and insisted that she should take
Jim to the &ldquo;prom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an honor for Jim!&rdquo; she put it.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be so set up. He&rsquo;s looking forward to
a calm, brotherly evening with me, and now
he&rsquo;ll find himself up in the receiving line,
jollying the patronesses and the class officers.
And I&mdash;oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I know plenty
of other men. But I do want Jim to have a
good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end Eleanor watched the prom. from
the gallery, except during three dances that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Rachel insisted upon her having with Jim.
She had looked forward to taking Jim to her
prom. too eagerly to care to put up with any
second-best escort, and besides the men she
had cultivated in her first two years at Harding&mdash;Paul
West and his set&mdash;were utterly
distasteful to her now.</p>

<p>Jean Eastman had her characteristic comment
to make on Eleanor&rsquo;s sacrifice. &ldquo;Bidding
for popularity with the class, I suppose,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;A very pretty play to the gallery
it is, and just before she comes up at Dramatic
Club, too. I wonder if it will work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was somewhat of a surprise to her
when she discovered at the next Dramatic
Club meeting that Eleanor had asked to have
her name definitely withdrawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t feel that it would be right for me
to go in,&rdquo; she explained to Miss Ferris and to
Betty Wales, the two who had seen her
through that trying sophomore spring term.
&ldquo;A Dramatic Club election is an official
honor, and it ought never to go to any one
who doesn&rsquo;t thoroughly deserve it. I got it
under false pretenses and I should never feel
as if it really belonged to me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small><small>HELEN&rsquo;S DAY&mdash;AND ELEANOR&rsquo;S</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a week after the &ldquo;prom.;&rdquo; all the
men had gone home, and all the violets had
faded, before anything else of particular interest
took place. Mary Brooks, to be sure,
had been going about wearing her preoccupied,
important air and had declined various invitations
on the plea that she was busy; but nobody
thought anything of that, because Mary
was always having periods of strenuous and
conscientious effort, surrounded on all sides,
as Katherine Kittredge put it, by periods of
the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Nearly all the &ldquo;literary&rdquo; juniors, together
with a good many like Betty Wales who were
not in the least literary, took Miss Raymond&rsquo;s
theme course. The bulletin boards were just
outside the door of her recitation room, so
that part of the hall was always noisy and
crowded between classes; and at the close of
the hour on this particular Wednesday morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ing
there seemed to be even more confusion
there than usual. But the class paid very
little heed to what was going on outside.
Miss Raymond had a way of bringing up interesting
points that the recitation period was
much too short to dispose of, and they sauntered
out in this usual leisurely fashion, arguing
about the merits of the theme that had
just been read&mdash;a spirited essay of Eleanor
Watson&rsquo;s. Helen Adams happened to be the
last one in the line, and at Miss Raymond&rsquo;s
desk she stopped to ask a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Raymond, could you tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she began timidly. Just then a tumult of
cries and a burst of gay applause came through
the half-open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they noisy this morning?&rdquo; laughed
Helen. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not Monday, so it can&rsquo;t be
about a society election.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Raymond was gathering up her books
and papers. &ldquo;Go out and see what it&rsquo;s about,&rdquo;
she said, smiling down at Helen&rsquo;s eager little
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I just wanted to ask&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Helen again.</p>

<p>Miss Raymond gave her a little push in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>direction of the door. &ldquo;Never mind that
now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You belong out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Helen went out, wondering at Miss
Raymond&rsquo;s insistence, into the tightly packed,
swaying mob of laughing, excited girls, who
all seemed to know what the noise and the
merriment were about. As Helen pushed
through the door, a girl whom she did not
know stretched out a hand to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Miss Adams,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Helen looked her bewilderment, and the
girl laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your note is on the bulletin board,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Miss Raymond tell
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a movement of the crowd tossed
Christy Mason forward toward Helen. Evidently
Christy had something to do with the
excitement. People were shaking hands with
her, and her face was radiant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else got one?&rdquo; Helen heard her ask
the girls around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marion Lustig,&rdquo; somebody told her, &ldquo;and
Emily Davis. I don&rsquo;t know who else. One
of the notes is still up there on the bulletin
board.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Mason,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;what is
it that you are, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I seem to be an editor of the &lsquo;Argus,&rsquo;&rdquo;
laughed Christy. &ldquo;Business manager, I
think the note says. Isn&rsquo;t it splendid&mdash;only
I don&rsquo;t see how it ever came to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s face flushed red, and then she got
white and faint and entirely forgot to congratulate
Christy, who was much too happy to
notice the omission. Could it be that she was
an editor? Was that what the girl near the
door had meant? Oh, she must have been
mistaken! Helen looked despairingly at the
bulletin board with the surging crowd of girls
between it and her. It seemed as if she
couldn&rsquo;t wait&mdash;as if she must know at once
whether or not there was anything there for
her.</p>

<p>Just then a voice cried, &ldquo;Pass this to Miss
Adams. She&rsquo;s standing by the door there,
and she can&rsquo;t get through the jam.&ldquo; In a
moment another girl whom Helen didn&rsquo;t
know, but who seemed to know her perfectly,
slipped something into her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy the work as much as
I have,&rdquo; the stranger said, shaking hands vig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>orously,
&ldquo;and I know you&rsquo;ll do it much
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Helen found herself suddenly a vortex
about which the crowd eddied and swarmed
as it had swarmed about Christy, shaking
hands, congratulating, complimenting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of course, it&rsquo;s no surprise to you,&rdquo;
one girl said. &ldquo;We were sure you&rsquo;d get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen only stared at her in blank amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I never dreamed of such a thing,&rdquo;
she told Betty a little later when the hall had
cleared and only the editors who did not have
a class the next hour and a few of their best
friends were left. &ldquo;Why, Betty Wales, just
think! I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m an editor of the &lsquo;Argus.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; laughed Betty. &ldquo;What does
the note say, Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t had time to open it.&rdquo; She looked at
it doubtfully. &ldquo;Betty, suppose there should
be some mistake. Suppose the note is about
something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Betty assured her. &ldquo;I heard
Mary Brooks say you were an editor, and of
course she knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus encouraged Helen opened her note
and read through its glorious contents.
&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; she said solemnly, passing it to her
to read, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody was ever
quite so happy as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except the other editors,&rdquo; suggested Betty
teasingly.</p>

<p>Helen shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe one
of them cares as much as I do. Who are the
others, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marion Lustig and Emily Davis and
Christy and Jane Drew and&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Eleanor of course,&rdquo; put in Helen.</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;Eleanor wasn&rsquo;t one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked perplexed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
why. She writes better than any one in the
class except Marion Lustig. Why hasn&rsquo;t the
&lsquo;Argus&rsquo; printed any of her things this year,
Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t want them printed, I think,
for one reason,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t
an editor have to do other things besides
write? Perhaps Eleanor isn&rsquo;t fitted for it in
other ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that she escaped to the library. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>had caught just a glimpse of Eleanor in the
crowd and seen the hunted look that came to
her face when somebody of Helen&rsquo;s opinion
said, &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re on the board, Miss
Watson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to choke her,&rdquo; Betty reflected,
&ldquo;but I suppose she wasn&rsquo;t to blame for not
having listened to unpleasant gossip. Poor
Eleanor! It&rsquo;s going to be a hard day for
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile little Helen Adams went blissfully
home to the Belden. Several times on the
way she pinched herself to make sure she was
awake. Up in her own room in the quiet of
the big empty house she sat down to think it
all over. She had been very lonely during
her freshman year&mdash;but that didn&rsquo;t matter
now. And the basket-ball song and the verses
and the quaint little essay on apple-trees that
the &ldquo;Argus&rdquo; had printed had meant long hours
of hard work and discouraged waiting for the
right words to come. But the struggles and
discouragements didn&rsquo;t matter now either, in
the face of this glorious, wholly unlooked-for
success.</p>

<p>Helen would have been amazed indeed if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>she could have heard Jean Eastman&rsquo;s view of
her position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry for her,&rdquo; Jean informed the
Westcott House lunch table. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;d
have been happier without this. She won&rsquo;t
fit in with the others. They&rsquo;ve all been prominent
girls ever since freshman year, and she&mdash;oh,
of course, she has some nice friends, but
only the ones she was thrown with at Mrs.
Chapin&rsquo;s and some freshmen she met through
her roommate. She isn&rsquo;t in Dramatic Club
or Clio, and she&rsquo;s never had any office in the
class. She&rsquo;ll feel the difference now, and
realize how she&rsquo;s been left out from everything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Now I can&rsquo;t imagine
anything more exciting than to be a &lsquo;dark
horse,&rsquo;&rdquo; volunteered a bright-eyed little
sophomore at the end of the table. &ldquo;Why,
everybody is talking about her to-day.
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s Helen Adams?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what they
all want to know. It must be splendid to
take people by surprise and just make them
find out about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds well,&rdquo; persisted Jean, &ldquo;but
in actual fact it&rsquo;s a different matter. You get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>the place that everybody thought belonged to
some one else&rdquo;&mdash;here Jean had the grace to
look a little uncomfortable, for her friends had
frequently assured her that she stood as good
a chance as anybody for a minor position on
the editorial staff&mdash;&ldquo;but you miss the fun
of it. You don&rsquo;t get the flowers and the
spreads and all that sort of thing that the
popular girls will have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway Miss Adams isn&rsquo;t going to
miss the spread,&rdquo; said the bright-eyed sophomore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to give it for her?&rdquo; demanded
Jean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Watson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean laughed disagreeably. &ldquo;Indeed! One
of Eleanor&rsquo;s quixotic philanthropies, I suppose.&rdquo;
She lowered her voice so that only the
little crowd of juniors near her could hear.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think that to-day of all days
she&rsquo;d have preferred to keep in the background?
But I suppose she thought that she
might as well be &lsquo;in it&rsquo; one way if she
couldn&rsquo;t the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first Eleanor&rsquo;s impulse had been just
what Jean had suggested. She wanted to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>into the background, away from the noisy
demonstrations and the curious or idle inquiries
about her omission from the &ldquo;Argus&rdquo;
board. Ever since she entered college, fully
informed by her upper class friends about all
the ways of putting oneself forward and all
the offices and honors that a clever girl might
aspire to, Eleanor had looked forward to the
day of the &ldquo;Argus&rdquo; elections as her hour of
greatest triumph. Now Emily Davis had the
place that might have been hers, and she was
slinking home by a back path, hoping to
avoid meeting any one. She looked across the
greening campus and saw little Helen Adams
also hurrying home. Her lips curled scornfully
as she watched Helen&rsquo;s joyous progress,
for to her as to Jean this late hard-won recognition
would have had in it more humiliation
than triumph. Then all at once her face
softened as the idea of the supper came to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any one else, except possibly
Betty, will think of it,&rdquo; she decided
swiftly, &ldquo;and perhaps it would please Helen
more if I should do it. Coming from some one
outside her special friends, it will seem like a
more general recognition.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p class="bgap">At the door of Helen&rsquo;s room she hesitated
and drew back to consider. All the editors
would be at Cuyler&rsquo;s that evening with parties
of their friends. Everybody who saw her
would either remember why she was not an
editor or wonder what the mysterious reason
could be.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img id="Illo5" src="images/i_302.jpg" width="400" alt="&ldquo;AT THE DOOR OF HELEN&rsquo;S ROOM SHE HESITATED" title=""  /></div>

<p class="center caption">AT THE DOOR OF HELEN&rsquo;S ROOM SHE HESITATED</p>

<p class="gap">&ldquo;I might wait until to-morrow,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;There would be fewer people
then, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be so conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no; to-night was the proper night for
an editorial spread, and Helen should have
the fun of being in the midst of things for
once.</p>

<p>So she knocked and explained her errand.
Helen&rsquo;s ecstasy of delight was almost pathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A supper at Cuyler&rsquo;s for me!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Oh, how lovely! How perfectly lovely!
Betty has ordered some flowers for me, and
now you do this! I haven&rsquo;t anything left to
wish for. I&rsquo;m sure I shall enjoy my one big
day as much as girls like you and Betty enjoy
all yours put together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will,&rdquo; said Eleanor, thinking
bitterly of the &ldquo;big day,&rdquo; when her story
came out in the &ldquo;Argus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think it is particularly nice of
you,&rdquo; went on Helen, earnestly, &ldquo;when we
all thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The look on Eleanor&rsquo;s
face warned her not to go on, and instead of
finishing her sentence she put her arms
around Eleanor and stood on tiptoe to kiss
her soft cheek.</p>

<p>Some of &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; had already
accepted invitations to other spreads, but two
of the B&rsquo;s were free and received Eleanor&rsquo;s
timidly proffered invitation with a heartiness
that surprised her and encouraged her beyond
measure to go on in the difficult rôle she had
chosen. Katherine could come, and Roberta.
Betty excused herself to Nita, who was entertaining
in honor of Christy, on the plea that
Helen would feel hurt if her freshman roommate
could not come to her spread, and Lucile
declared that she was almost as &ldquo;set up&rdquo; by
being invited to a junior party as Helen was
by being elected editor. So every one was in
the best of spirits and the &ldquo;dark horse spread,&rdquo;
as Jean called it, was the gayest of all the editorial
celebrations.</p>

<p>All the parties broke up at about the same
time, and went up the hill to the campus in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>long, straggling line. Without any particular
manœuvering &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo; found
themselves together in the rear, with no outsiders
in their midst but Eleanor. At the
campus gate Bob stopped the tail of the procession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait a minute, girls,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Mary, I want to call a meeting of &lsquo;The
Merry Hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mary, taking her place
under the gate lantern. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called. What
is the business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eleanor had drawn off to one side, uncertain
whether it would be more tactful to go or
stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just to elect Eleanor Watson a member,&rdquo;
announced Bob, calmly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Eleanor.
I&rsquo;ve sounded them all, and they all want you.
This is only a formality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The formality was quickly disposed of after
the very informal fashion of the society, and
Eleanor found herself wearing Babe&rsquo;s cherished
pin and having the objects and rules
of the society explained to her by Babbie
Hildreth and Nita Reese, who had been her
most implacable critics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we changed our minds,&rdquo; Bob was
meanwhile explaining to Madeline, whom she
had pulled back to a safe distance for confidences.
&ldquo;We felt pretty mean the night of
the prom., and to-day I told Babe that anybody
who was generous enough, after everything,
to give Helen Chase Adams a spread,
and brave enough to face it out down there at
Cuyler&rsquo;s,&mdash;well, that for all that she deserved
something in place of what she didn&rsquo;t get. I
hope she was pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alone in her room a little later Eleanor
caught sight of her happy face in a mirror,
and laughed at herself for being so absurdly
pleased about such a little thing. &ldquo;But after
all it isn&rsquo;t such a very little thing,&rdquo; she reflected.
&ldquo;It means that they&rsquo;re beginning to
trust me again, and that&rsquo;s at the bottom of
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the happiest person in Harding College
that night was Betty Wales.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is getting fixed,&rdquo; she told the
green lizard joyously. &ldquo;Eleanor is a &lsquo;Merry
Heart&rsquo; and Helen is an editor. It does seem
as if there was nothing more left to bother
about.&rdquo; The ten o&rsquo;clock gong sounded omi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>nously
through the halls and Betty jumped
for her light. &ldquo;There is always the ten
o&rsquo;clock rule,&rdquo; she sighed, and then she
laughed. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t bother about things
for anything,&rdquo; she said as she tumbled wearily
into bed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small><small>A DRESS REFORM AND A NASSAU REUNION</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span> came home one lovely afternoon
in May looking very sober indeed for
her. But her face brightened instantly when
she found a note from Ethel stuck in her
mirror.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">&ldquo;Dear little sister&ldquo;&mdash;she read&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you and all the Nassau girls come
for an al fresco supper with me to-morrow
night? My balcony has a view of Paradise,
and the sun will be going down at six. Will
you ask the others?</p>

<p class="right3">&ldquo;Yours, in a hurry,</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;How dear of her!&rdquo; thought Betty, and
ran out to give Madeline her invitation and
incidentally to find out what al fresco meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she sighed in great relief when
Madeline had explained that it was Italian
for out-of-doors. &ldquo;I thought perhaps she
wanted us to come in costume or have quota<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>tions
from Shakespeare or something. I&rsquo;m
glad it&rsquo;s nothing learned like that. Madeline,
are you a junior usher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head. &ldquo;Rachel asked
me, but I told her I couldn&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty laughed. &ldquo;Junior ushering isn&rsquo;t
generally considered a bother, Miss Ayres.
It&rsquo;s a great honor and a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is honor but an empty bubble?&rdquo;
declaimed Madeline gaily. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t see
where the fun comes in. You have to stand
up behind when you usher. I&rsquo;d rather sit
down in front. Besides, most of commencement
is deadly dull. While you are hurrying
around in the heat spoiling your best clothes
and being bored I shall go trolley-riding, or
if there&rsquo;s something I want to see, like the
Ivy Day procession, I can hang out of my
window in a comfortable kimono&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, Madeline,&rdquo; exclaimed
Betty in horror-struck tones, &ldquo;with the
campus full of mothers and men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline laughed. &ldquo;No, strictly speaking
I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t own a
kimono since I gave my red silk one to the
Nassau wash-lady who admired it, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>draw the line at borrowing clothes. I should
have to borrow some, though, if I ushered. I
haven&rsquo;t anything that would look even
presentable beside the dreams of elegance
and beauty that you people are going to
wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty jumped up with a start. &ldquo;Good-bye,
Madeline,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must go and tell the
B&rsquo;s about Ethel&rsquo;s supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She found Babbie taking the wrappings off
of a bulky package that the expressman had
just brought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in my wrapper when he knocked,&rdquo;
explained Babbie cheerfully, &ldquo;and I thought
of course it was Bob, because she walks just
like a man, so I said, &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo; And all my
bureau drawers were tumbled out on Babe&rsquo;s
bed. But I guess he&rsquo;s seen things like that
before, if he&rsquo;s been in Harding long. It&rsquo;s my
junior usher dress, Betty. How these knots
do stick! And since I used my scissors to
cut picture wire they won&rsquo;t cut string.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Betty&rsquo;s help the troublesome knots
were all undone at last, and Babbie shook out
her new dress with a little sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s made princess,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and
see the lace! Why, it&rsquo;s fairly covered. Betty,
isn&rsquo;t my mother a darling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty gazed admiringly at the filmy, beruffled
gown, with its rows upon rows of
tucking and shirring, and its dainty trimmings
of hand embroidery and real lace.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect beauty, Babbie,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll look like a beauty in it, you&rsquo;re
so slight and dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babbie, who had found a note pinned to
the dress, gave a little squeal of pleasure.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a check for a hat,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Mother says that I don&rsquo;t need a new white
hat one bit, but that considering I&rsquo;ve lived
within my allowance I may have one. Oh,
Betty, I do feel guilty about that maid&rsquo;s
wages. And yet the money has helped
Emily Davis a lot&mdash;a little of the money, I
mean. And what could I do with a maid?&rdquo;
Her eyes fell on the chaos on Babe&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;I
wish I had one for an hour to straighten out
that mess. I shall make Babe help because I
was hunting for her history note-book when
I emptied them out, and she had it all the
time herself.&rdquo; She turned to Betty. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>the matter with you, Betty Wales? You&rsquo;re
as sober as a judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty waited a minute. &ldquo;Oh, Babbie, I
hate to tell you, but I do want you to help.
You know Rachel tried to pick out some of
the girls to usher who hadn&rsquo;t had as many
good times as the rest of us, like Helen and
Lotta Gardner and that quiet Miss Ray who
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any friends. They all
seemed so pleased, but to-day Lotta and Miss
Ray came to her and said they&rsquo;d decided they
couldn&rsquo;t stay to commencement. Rachel felt
around and found out that the trouble was
they thought their dresses wouldn&rsquo;t do to
usher in. They had heard that everything
was going to be so very elegant this year.
And just now, while I was down at Rachel&rsquo;s,
Emily Davis came in and refused for the same
reason. She didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the grand
effect, she said, with a dowdy dress. We
tried to make her think her dimity was all
right, but we couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Babbie coldly, putting
out a slim hand to straighten a fold in her
new gown.</p>

<p>Betty hesitated. &ldquo;Why, I thought that if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>some of us&mdash;in &lsquo;The Merry Hearts&rsquo; perhaps&mdash;should
agree&mdash;I thought&mdash;oh, Babbie, of course
you want to wear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Babbie briefly, &ldquo;I want to
wear it. Don&rsquo;t you want to wear yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing so elegant as
this, but it&rsquo;s very dear, and it&rsquo;s not&mdash;not
what you&rsquo;d call simple. Babbie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I think Rachel is worrying
about her own dress. She wouldn&rsquo;t admit it,
but she brought it out to show me, and it&rsquo;s
very plain and it&rsquo;s been washed a lot of times.
You know she and Christy walk at the head
of the Ivy Day procession, in front of the
senior president and vice-president. Of course
Christy will have a lovely dress and the
seniors&rsquo; officers are both wealthy girls. Rachel
said she hoped her class wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed
of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babbie picked up the box her dress had
been packed in. There were big bunches of
purple violets all over it, and a faint scent of
violets exhaled from it as she gave it a vigorous
toss to the further corner of her long
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We ashamed
of Rachel Morrison!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swept up her new dress and hung it out
of sight in the remotest depths of her closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, coming back to sit once
more on the couch. &ldquo;I can wear it down to
dinner some night, I suppose, so that mother
won&rsquo;t notice it&rsquo;s never been on. I shouldn&rsquo;t
like to hurt her feelings. And now the question
is shall I look worse in a white duck suit
that I wore mornings last year or in an organdy
that the washwoman ironed so that it&rsquo;s halfway
up to my knees across the front and lies
on the floor everywhere else. I think myself
I should look more like the fair Miss Gardner
in the organdy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Babbie, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged Betty.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t feel that way. Nobody wants
us to look like frumps. I only thought it
would be a splendid thing if we should agree
to wear dresses more like what any girl in the
class could afford to have. But don&rsquo;t do it
unless you want to, Babbie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babbie kicked the fringe of the couch cover
savagely with her shiny, high-heeled
slipper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, Betty Wales,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>declared. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t pretend that I want
to, but&mdash;oh, you queer old Power behind the
Throne!&rdquo; She leaned forward, scattering the
pillows right and left, and enveloped Betty in
a riotous hug. &ldquo;I might just as well do what
you say first as last. The reason why you get
what you want when the rest of us can&rsquo;t is because
you always want the right kind of
things. It is absurd, of course, to have such
expensive dresses when they&rsquo;re almost sure to
be trampled on in the crowd and ruined the
first time we wear them, and it&rsquo;s mean too, I
suppose, if it hurts people&rsquo;s feelings. So here
goes for the simple life!&rdquo; Babbie sent one
shiny slipper flying after the violet-scented
box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Babbie, you are a dear!&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s eyes
sparkled with pleasure. &ldquo;If you and Christy
and Nita and Alice Waite and a few of the
others who always have pretty clothes will
agree to it, why it will spread, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Jean Eastman, who probably won&rsquo;t
agree to it, because she didn&rsquo;t think of it first,
will find herself out in the cold where she belongs,&rdquo;
remarked Babbie affably. &ldquo;And
now the question still is how to dress for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>part of Miss Simplicity. What shall you
wear, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, all my thin things faded so in the
sun down at Nassau that they are frights,&rdquo;
Betty explained. &ldquo;I thought it would be fun
to make a dress, Babbie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babbie looked dubious for a moment and
then her face cleared. &ldquo;It might be fun
enough,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I know what!
Seven dollars isn&rsquo;t too much to spend, is it?
I have just that much now, and I&rsquo;ll risk a
pound of Huyler&rsquo;s on it, Betty Wales, that I
can make a better-looking dress for seven dollars
than you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Betty laughingly.
&ldquo;And of course you understand, Babbie, that
we mustn&rsquo;t explain we&rsquo;re doing it on account
of any particular girls, but just on general
principles. I&rsquo;ll tell Rachel to see that the
right ones hear about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Babbie, who was
hurrying into a shirt-waist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to inform
the fair Miss Gardner that I&rsquo;m trying to
look like her second cousin. I&rsquo;ll remember.
Go and tell Babe, Betty. She&rsquo;s down in
Christy&rsquo;s room. And as soon as I&rsquo;m dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>we&rsquo;ll go and buy the things. Bob&rsquo;s clothes
are always frights, no matter what they cost,
so it&rsquo;s no use bothering with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christy received Betty&rsquo;s suggestion with
hearty approval. &ldquo;We certainly want to
keep Harding College so that every girl, no
matter who she is, can enjoy it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And the only way to do that is to keep
clothes in the background and brains and real
good times in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would wear a simple muslin,&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
really a lot more becoming than the other
fussed up one,&rdquo; she confessed, laughingly,&mdash;and
she promised to see Nita and half a dozen
others who would be at the committee meeting
she was just hurrying off to. Babe joined
the shopping expedition, insisting that her
dress should enter the competition with
Betty&rsquo;s and Babbie&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Only I shall hire the
buttonholes done,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
make buttonholes fit to be seen at the commencement
of a cat&rsquo;s orphan asylum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was surprising how many junior ushers
were down-town that afternoon and how
eagerly most of them took up with &ldquo;the simple
life,&rdquo; as Babbie called it. A good many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>were pleased to be asked to join a movement
headed by Christy, Betty and the rich and
exclusive Babbie Hildreth, who gave it just
the stamp that Betty had counted on in asking
her coöperation. Others were relieved to
find that an elaborate new dress would not be
needed. A few of course declared that the
seniors would be disappointed and 19&mdash; disgraced
if the ushers appeared in &ldquo;duds.&rdquo; But
these last were so hopelessly in the minority
that they could safely be ignored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, they&rsquo;ll come around fast enough
when they find out who&rsquo;s for the simple life,&rdquo;
said Babe decidedly. &ldquo;As for the seniors,
they&rsquo;ll be mighty sorry that they didn&rsquo;t set a
precedent for inexpensive commencement
dresses. I tell you 19&mdash; is such a fine class
that what it says goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Betty says goes, you mean,&rdquo; corrected
Babbie, patting her bundle of lace and
lawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; begged Betty. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
do any more than the rest of you. And that
reminds me that I haven&rsquo;t told you but half
of what I came to your room to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bgap">Babbie made an imploring gesture. &ldquo;Please
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t be nice about anything more
just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center caption">THE NASSAU PARTY MEET BY MARY&rsquo;S HAMMOCK</p>

<p class="gap">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want you to be,&rdquo; Betty assured
her solemnly. &ldquo;This is another kind of
thing altogether.&rdquo; Whereupon she was allowed
to deliver Miss Hale&rsquo;s invitation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Nassau party met by Mary&rsquo;s hammock
under the apple-trees, which were now fast
losing their freight of snowy blossoms, and
walked up to Ethel&rsquo;s together. On the way
they argued good-naturedly over the possibility
of their hearing anything about the romance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there isn&rsquo;t any to hear about
now,&rdquo; said Mary, sadly. &ldquo;But it certainly
had a beautiful start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Start, did you say?&rdquo; demanded Madeline
with an irritating smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; returned Mary, calmly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see how you can possibly deny that for
two people who barely knew each other before,
they got along amazingly fast. I shan&rsquo;t argue
any more about particular cases, but certainly
if we hadn&rsquo;t taken Miss Hale to Nassau, Dr.
Eaton would never have fallen in love with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>her. That&rsquo;s a romance in itself. But I suppose
you&rsquo;d say that he wasn&rsquo;t in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Madeline,
promptly. &ldquo;Should you, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; laughed Betty,
thinking of the orange blossoms and her
queer interview with Dr. Eaton on shipboard.
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t give my reasons against the
match-making theory and Madeline won&rsquo;t
give hers, so let&rsquo;s not argue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially as it has probably all come to
nothing,&rdquo; said Babe. &ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;ll be lots
to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a perfect summer evening, and the
up-stairs piazza, to which the girls were at
once ushered, with its daintily spread table,
its flowers, and its view of Paradise pond and
the clear gold of the sunset sky, was so pretty
that there was a chorus of delighted exclamations.</p>

<p>There was certainly &ldquo;lots to eat,&rdquo; as Babe
had hoped, and Ethel had not forgotten what
tastes good to college girls toward the end of
spring term. Everything was cool and crisp
and as different as possible from conventional
campus fare. There was a centrepiece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>ferns and a red rose at each place, and presently
it began to dawn on the girls that everything
was red and green. Strawberries on
their own stems, radishes nestled in feathery
parsley, tomatoes on lettuce leaves, gave a
touch of 19&mdash;&rsquo;s color, combined with the
scarlet of their freshman allies, to each course.
After the parti-colored ice had been finished,
and the hostess&rsquo;s health drunk in lemonade
(with red cherries in the bottom of each slender
green glass) there was a sudden lull in the
conversation and then Miss Hale began to
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she said, looking very solemnly
around the circle of eager faces, &ldquo;I asked you
here to-day because I wanted to make sure of
seeing you all once more before I leave. I&rsquo;m
not coming back next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Hale&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Mary Brooks
impulsively, and paused, noticing how sober
Ethel&rsquo;s face was, and not daring to go on with
her question. &ldquo;We shall miss you awfully&mdash;I
mean the others will,&rdquo; she ended in some
confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Eleanor Watson eagerly,
&ldquo;I shall for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I. And I,&rdquo; echoed the rest, while
Betty Wales watched Ethel&rsquo;s face and wished
she had her alone to catechize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you ought to have
stayed until I got through. I shan&rsquo;t know
what to do without any grown-up person to
look out for me. I shall be just forlorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Betty!&rdquo; said Ethel, with a very faint
smile. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Nan come and see you sometimes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to teach somewhere else,
Miss Hale?&rdquo; asked Helen Adams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teach? Oh, only one private pupil, I
think,&rdquo; said Miss Hale soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not tired out,&rdquo; observed
Babbie Hildreth politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not at all tired since my restful
vacation,&rdquo; responded Miss Hale cordially.</p>

<p>The girls exchanged covert glances. Nobody
quite dared to put the question that was
uppermost in everybody&rsquo;s thought. No one
could think of any more &ldquo;feelers&rdquo; and there
seemed to be nothing else to talk about. So
an awkward silence fell upon the circle, which
Ethel, in her capacity of hostess, made no
effort to lift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what a beautiful night it is,&rdquo; said
Mary Brooks at last in desperation. But no
one paid any attention to her, for just at that
moment Betty Wales gave a little cry of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re engaged!
You&rsquo;re just trying to bother us by looking so
sober. I can see your lips twitch from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel&rsquo;s preternaturally solemn face flashed
suddenly into a radiant smile. &ldquo;I wondered
how long it would take you to come to it,&rdquo;
she said demurely. &ldquo;Yes, little sister, I&rsquo;m
engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve guessed right
about,&rdquo; cried Betty Wales, looking triumphantly
at Mary Brooks. &ldquo;Oh, Ethel, I&rsquo;m so
glad. I was so afraid you didn&rsquo;t like him,
and I think he&rsquo;s so nice&mdash;we all do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel laughed again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you approve.
Are you quite sure who &lsquo;he&rsquo; is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty confidently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe there is any doubt about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Hale, aren&rsquo;t you glad you went
to Nassau?&rdquo; demanded Mary Brooks, coming
to the point at once in her usual energetic
fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Hale smiled at her eagerness. &ldquo;You
little romancers! I suppose you&rsquo;ve been
making up a story-book affair, with love at
first sight and moonlight in the tropics, and
just reveling in it. I hate to spoil your
romance, but we&rsquo;ve known each other since
my freshman year at Harding, and I&rsquo;ve been
this whole winter making up my mind to be
engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Madeline triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Betty Wales before she
thought.</p>

<p>Ethel looked in bewilderment from them to
the others, whose faces had fallen, and Betty
came to her rescue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, Ethel,&rdquo;
she explained, &ldquo;only the rest did think it all
happened in Nassau, and we thought it
couldn&rsquo;t have. Please go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on?&rdquo; repeated Ethel uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us how it really happened,&rdquo; begged
Betty, &ldquo;and why it seemed to stop off short
and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel looked round the circle of eager faces.
&ldquo;Then you must promise not to talk about
it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; they chorused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t said a word so far,&rdquo; declared
Bob proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you haven&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s why I decided
to tell you first of all, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Ethel
hesitated again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so absurd. But of
course you want to know. Why, last fall
when Mr. Eaton told me he was coming here
to teach, I&mdash;you can imagine how I felt&mdash;when
he&rsquo;d given me a year to think it over
in&mdash;to decide between my work and marrying
him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then he came to watch you think?&rdquo;
suggested Helen Adams quaintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; laughed Ethel. &ldquo;That was just
it, and while he watched me, every one else
would be watching both of us. I told him it
was an impossible arrangement, but it seemed
impossible for him to withdraw then, so I
made him promise to leave me entirely alone
and not to let any one guess that we had
known each other before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; cried Mary Brooks delightedly.
&ldquo;What a funny idea! And after the Nassau
trip you went back to it again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel&rsquo;s dimples came into sudden play.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that was the agreement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>When I found that instead of running away
from Mr. Eaton I had taken passage on the
same boat with him, we decided that the only
thing to do was to seem reasonably friendly,
or else you girls would wonder what the matter
was, and then&rdquo;&mdash;Ethel blushed hotly&mdash;&ldquo;it
was dreadfully awkward. We were
always being either too distant or too friendly,
but I couldn&rsquo;t explain, so I had to trust you
girls not to gossip. I knew I could. And&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s every bit there is to tell, little
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Nassau did help you to make up
your mind?&rdquo; asked Mary, anxiously.</p>

<p>Ethel laughed. &ldquo;Dr. Eaton says it did,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;He told me particularly to thank
you all for bringing me down there. But I
think&mdash;well, to tell you the truth, I think my
mind was already made up, only I didn&rsquo;t
know it. It seems to me now that I might
have decided last summer and saved all this&mdash;this
ridiculous explanation,&rdquo; ended Ethel,
smiling happily at her eager little audience.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a maid appeared with
cards for Miss Hale, and &ldquo;The Merry Hearts&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>realized suddenly that it was time to go
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember it&rsquo;s not regularly announced
until to-morrow night,&rdquo; Ethel warned them,
as they went down the steps singing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to our Miss Hale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May she never, never fail,&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">at the top of nine vigorous lungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mary Brooks, when the tribute
of song was duly paid, &ldquo;the moral of that is:
appearances are deceitful, particularly when
they are meant to be deceitful. Madeline,
how in the world did you find out that they&rsquo;d
known each other before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Eaton said he&rsquo;d been to a Harding
prom., and I rudely asked him with whom,&rdquo;
confessed Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how about you, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had more opportunities to notice
Ethel than the rest of you,&rdquo; said Betty,
evasively. &ldquo;I only put little things together
and guessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not going to give Mary&rsquo;s faction a
chance to crow over her, but having heard
Ethel&rsquo;s story, she was privately of the opin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>ion
that the Nassau trip, though not perhaps
the match-makers&rsquo; devices, had helped Ethel
to decide her momentous question. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what was worrying her before vacation,&rdquo; she
reflected, &ldquo;and it made her queer and changeable
on the trip. One minute she thought
she was going to be married, and the next she
was afraid she wasn&rsquo;t. But as soon as she got
back to her beloved work she found out that
she liked him best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; piped up Helen Adams, &ldquo;she said
she might have one private pupil. Do you
suppose she meant Dr. Eaton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she meant a Swedish maid,&rdquo;
chuckled Babe, irreverently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; cried Betty, stopping stock-still in
the campus gateway. &ldquo;If she marries Dr.
Eaton maybe she&rsquo;ll live here next year. We
never asked her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are elected to find out at the earliest
opportunity,&rdquo; said Mary Brooks. &ldquo;As for
me, I&rsquo;m going home to copy the novel. I&rsquo;m
going to leave it just as it is and call it &lsquo;As It
Might Have Been; or, More Than Half
True.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Less Than Half True&rsquo; would be better, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>think,&rdquo; said Madeline, &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t quarrel.
Girls, do you realize that every quarrel
we have with President Brooks nowadays
may be our last?&rdquo;</p>

<small><small>THE RETURN OF GEORGIA AND SOME OTHER<br />
MATTERS</small></small></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel</span> was not going to live at Harding.
On the afternoon after the announcement
supper Betty flew up to inquire, and found to
her disappointment that Dr. Eaton&rsquo;s first year
at Harding was also to be his last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, he&rsquo;s a wealthy man, little sister,&rdquo;
Ethel explained, &ldquo;and he only taught this
year to please me&mdash;because I accused him
once of being very idle, and said I didn&rsquo;t want
to marry a drone, no matter how clever he
was or how many learned degrees he had
taken. He&rsquo;s written a book this winter, too.
I&rsquo;m so proud of him! Next year we&rsquo;re going
to live in New York, so he can be near his
publishers, and some day early in the fall you
must come down and let me see whether
being a senior makes you look one bit
older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty promised joyously and hurried back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>to the campus. Last days are strenuous for
junior ushers, especially when they are making
their own dresses and have in addition a
particular friend in the senior class to do all
the last pleasant things for.</p>

<p>Mary Brooks had never seemed so dear and
amusing as she did now that they were going
to lose her. Marion Lawrence was going too,
and to her utter consternation Madeline Ayres
discovered at the last moment that she also
could graduate, if she chose to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious, but I was scared,&rdquo; she explained
inelegantly, coming into Betty&rsquo;s room one
night just after ten. &ldquo;When Miss Stuart said
&lsquo;You have credits enough to take your degree,
Miss Ayres; I thought you understood
that your junior rank was merely nominal,
due to your irregular preparation,&rsquo; I gasped
out, &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t have to take it now, do I,
Miss Stuart?&rsquo; She looked at me as if she
thought I must be suddenly stricken with
idiocy, and said she supposed not, but that
she had never before had any one object to
graduating too soon. I told her I thought
plenty of people objected fast enough, but
that I was the first one who had had a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>excuse for telling her so. Then she laughed
and we got quite chummy over the joys of
being a Harding girl as long as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they won&rsquo;t make you go?&rdquo; asked
Betty anxiously.</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head. &ldquo;Of course I
could have come back anyway for graduate
work, but I didn&rsquo;t want to do that. I want
to be in 19&mdash; forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny how much that counts?&rdquo;
said Betty, turning on her light. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care if the night-watchman does see it,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it not to show you
my dress. I finished it this morning and it&rsquo;s
all pressed and ready to put on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline inspected the dress critically.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely, Betty. Does it win the contest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty laughed. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t settle that,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Babbie&rsquo;s is a lot prettier, but it
cost seven cents over the seven dollars, so
we refuse to get her the candy. Mine is
next, but Babbie won&rsquo;t pay up because we
admit that hers is prettier. And now Lotta
Gardner&rsquo;s mother is sick and she can&rsquo;t stay
to commencement. So I don&rsquo;t know as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>was much use making Babbie give up that
dream of a dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; declared Madeline
positively. &ldquo;You know very well that Lotta
wasn&rsquo;t the only girl who was going to be made
uncomfortable. Besides, the principle is right,
and that&rsquo;s what really counts. The girls are
stirred up about lessening other expenses and
it will make a lot of difference next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope so. I hope they don&rsquo;t think
it was a big fuss over nothing,&rdquo; said Betty,
stifling a yawn. &ldquo;Oh, Madeline, I&rsquo;m so happy
to think that my last examination is over
and there&rsquo;s only fun ahead. Don&rsquo;t you wish
now that you were an usher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head. &ldquo;Only so that
I could be in on the right side of the dress
reform movement,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Farmers&rsquo;
Almanac predicts sizzling weather for next
week, and I foresee that you&rsquo;ll all be overcome
by heat and weariness, whereas I shall
sit in peace in the gymnasium basement
and other cool and shady nooks and only
venture out into the open after sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Farmers&rsquo; Almanac and Madeline were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>both right. Never in the history of Harding
College had there been a hotter commencement,
and it was a weary little group of
junior ushers who gathered in the gymnasium
gallery on the last day of all, &ldquo;to watch the
animals feed,&rdquo; as Katherine Kittredge put it,
&ldquo;and by and by to pick up a few crumbs ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody but the seniors and the junior
ushers had gone home, and all the cooks and
waitresses from the campus houses were helping
to serve the annual collation to the
seniors, faculty and visiting alumnæ. &ldquo;So
it&rsquo;s wait for crumbs here or starve,&rdquo; Katherine
added sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d better have gone down-town,&rdquo;
sighed Babbie Hildreth. &ldquo;Perhaps
we&rsquo;d better go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t afford to,&rdquo; objected Betty.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to borrow fifteen cents to get
my trunk to the station to-morrow, as it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your trunk won&rsquo;t do you any good
if you die of hunger,&rdquo; retorted Babbie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to do that,&rdquo;
laughed Rachel Morrison. &ldquo;I saw Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>Brooks talking to Belden-House-Annie, and
yes&mdash;here she comes this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brooks tole me ye were starvin&rsquo; up
here,&rdquo; said the grinning Irish maid, whose
gay good-nature had made her a favorite with
generations of Harding girls. &ldquo;You take
this &rsquo;ere salad and san&rsquo;wiches, and I&rsquo;ll be
afther findin&rsquo; yez some cake an&rsquo; cream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annie, you&rsquo;re an angel,&rdquo; said Betty,
solemnly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve saved our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s glad I am of that,&rdquo; said Annie,
rushing off with her empty tray, while the
girls carried their heaped-up plates to the
stairs and sat down to rest and feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ushed&rsquo; our last &lsquo;ush,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Katherine, &ldquo;and the seniors are alums
and we&rsquo;re seniors. And if I do say it as
shouldn&rsquo;t, I think we&rsquo;re a fine class. Do you
know, our dress reform has made quite a little
sensation? All the anxious alums who are
sure every time they came back that the
college is getting fashionable and haughty
and good-for-nothing are patting us on the
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were pretty, too,&rdquo; said Babbie, looking
complacently at a grass stain on the front-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>breadth
of hers. &ldquo;But do you really think
people noticed the difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed they did,&rdquo; said Rachel earnestly,
&ldquo;and I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she lifted a warning
finger. &ldquo;Why is it so still out there all
of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prexy must be making a speech,&rdquo; said
Babbie, who was an authority on commencements,
since she had stayed to all three to see
the last of some adored senior. &ldquo;I remember
he did last year, when he thought they&rsquo;d eaten
enough. I was waiting for Marie Nelson, and I
was so much obliged to him for ending things
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said Rachel, setting down
her plate and scrambling to her feet. &ldquo;He
announces the legacies to the college at collation.
Let&rsquo;s go in and hear how much money
Harding has got this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stir for a million dollars,&rdquo;
sighed Babbie wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other three reached the gallery just
in time to hear a burst of half-hearted applause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That couldn&rsquo;t have been a very big one,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>whispered Katherine. &ldquo;I suppose he begins
with the smallest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next came a gift for the library, which had
suffered a good deal at the time of the fire,
then a new European fellowship, and finally
a ten thousand dollar legacy from the father
of a prominent alumna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home to pack,&rdquo; whispered
Katherine. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t exciting enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute and we&rsquo;ll all go,&rdquo; returned
Rachel.</p>

<p>The president gave a significant little cough
and glanced around the gym.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last gift is a complete surprise to
me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;As I was on my way
here, I met the donor. In fact he was waiting
outside the door to intercept me, which
isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;the president&rsquo;s gray eyes twinkled&mdash;&ldquo;the
way all gifts come to colleges. He
has been spending the commencement season
with us and during his brief stay he seems to
have found out a good deal about Harding.
He likes some things about our college very
much, he says; and other things he would
prefer to see changed. But he wants it made
quite clear to you all that the reason why he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>just now handed me a check for fifty thousand
dollars is because of the stand the junior class
has taken in regard to the dresses they
wore to usher in at the various commencement
festivities. He liked those dresses as
much as a great many other people have
liked them&rdquo;&mdash;the president&rsquo;s eyes twinkled
again&mdash;&ldquo;and he liked the principle behind
them. He wishes the junior class, when it
reassembles next fall as the senior class, to
vote ten of the fifty thousand dollars to any
department of our work it chooses, and he
hopes the spirit of Harding College may always
be the spirit which this class has manifested,
not on this occasion alone but on
many others, in which wish I heartily join
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great wave of applause swept over the
crowd, as the president paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am authorized to do
so,&rdquo; he went on when he could be heard, &ldquo;but
I think I may safely say that 19&mdash; will accept
the trust&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The junior president is in the gallery,&rdquo;
called some one in the back of the hall, and
the next minute every one was looking up at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>Rachel Morrison, who was too busy shaking
hands with Betty and Katherine to notice
what was happening down below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speech!&rdquo; shouted a boisterous young
alumna, quite forgetting the dignity of the
occasion, and the august president of the college
tossed back his head and laughed with
the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speech, Miss Morrison,&rdquo; he repeated gaily,
and Rachel came forward to the balcony railing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;19&mdash; is very proud,&rdquo; she began bravely,
&ldquo;to be the means of securing such a splendid
gift for the college. But I think the proper
person to make acknowledgment is the one
who originated the idea of having the ushers
dress as they did. She is right here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rachel turned just in time to see Betty
Wales disappearing hastily through the nearest
exit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was here a moment ago,&rdquo; Rachel corrected
herself, &ldquo;but I&mdash;I thank you&mdash;the class
thanks the donor&mdash;and promises to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all that Betty Wales heard, except
the deafening thunder of applause. &ldquo;I
should die if I had to make a speech,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>thought, rushing past Babbie with an incoherent
murmur about being in a hurry.
Once safely outside the gym. she paused,
wishing the others would come out quickly.
They had planned to go for a long trolley-ride
late in the afternoon and take supper together
at a little country inn, and the time
and place of meeting were yet to be decided
upon. Before she had decided what to do,
Madeline Ayres, who had persuaded the
Belden House matron to let her stay as long
as the ushers did, and Bob Parker bore down
upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess what we&rsquo;ve found,&rdquo; called Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty, faintly, wondering
if they could possibly have been
deputed to return her to the gym.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d seen a ghost,&rdquo; said
Bob. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had any lunch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty nodded. &ldquo;Oh, yes, plenty, thank
you. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been hurrying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why,&rdquo; said Madeline,
&ldquo;when your trunk is packed and Mary
Brooks&rsquo;s last relative went this noon. Listen,
Betty. We&rsquo;ve found Georgia Ames.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty stared in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; insisted Bob, &ldquo;got her in flesh and
blood this time. She&rsquo;s a freshman, or at least
she&rsquo;s taking her entrance exams, and hoping
to be one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find out about her?&rdquo; demanded
Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Stuart told us,&rdquo; Madeline explained.
&ldquo;She thought it was a lovely joke. And we
stood at the door of the room where Miss
Stuart said she was taking her English exam,
and stopped each girl who came out until we
got the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she look like her picture?&rdquo; demanded
Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Madeline. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dark
and rather stout and she wears her hair in a
braid. She&rsquo;s not pretty, but she&rsquo;s jolly-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she thinks she&rsquo;s flunked her English,&rdquo;
chuckled Bob. &ldquo;Fancy Georgia&rsquo;s
flunking in English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father&rsquo;s name is Edward,&rdquo; contributed
Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her mother is dead,&rdquo; added Bob,
softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Can&rsquo;t I see her?&rdquo; asked
Betty, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. She&rsquo;s going off with us to-night,&rdquo;
said Madeline. &ldquo;We thought it was
no more than decent to take her&mdash;considering
that she&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Merry Heart&rsquo; and that we&rsquo;ve got
to make up to her for all the jollying she&rsquo;ll
get next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Rachel, Katherine and Babbie
appeared and fell upon Betty and there were
explanations from both parties and a joyous
interchange of congratulations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the others be sorry they went home
this noon,&rdquo; declared Katherine, &ldquo;just in time
to miss all these fine doings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And won&rsquo;t Mary Brooks be wild to think
she can&rsquo;t go with us to-night to help amuse
Georgia,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Mary now,&rdquo; said Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty Wales, I am so proud of you,&rdquo;
cried Mary, breathlessly, dropping her diploma
to hug Betty more effectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I, Mary,&rdquo; protested Betty.
&ldquo;Rachel was too bad. Oh, please don&rsquo;t act
so, girls, and come away before any one else
gets here. Mary, Georgia has come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary&rsquo;s bewilderment and then her chagrin
were delightful to behold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is anything in the world that I&rsquo;d
cut my own class-supper for,&rdquo; she declared,
&ldquo;it would be to see Georgia Ames. But I
can&rsquo;t even wait now to meet her. I have a
toast to write. &lsquo;Be funny, Mary,&rsquo; the toast
mistress said. As if anybody could be funny
at her own class-supper! Don&rsquo;t be back too
late to serenade us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls promised and then everybody
hurried off to pack or to rest and cool off before
it was time to start on the evening jaunt.</p>

<p>As Betty took off her &ldquo;usher dress&rdquo; and
laid it carefully into her least crowded trunk-tray,
she gave a rapturous little sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money
to come from such a little thing,&rdquo; she told the
green lizard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to worry any
more about little things not counting. Everything
counts here. Why even doubles that
you make up come to life on your hands, and
match-making comes out the way you wanted
it to and thought it couldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just the
loveliest place! I&rsquo;m so glad I have another
year of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sudden burst of song under her
window. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re singing to somebody,&rdquo;
thought Betty. &ldquo;I wonder who. Why&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
to me!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Betty Wales, drink her down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s to Betty Wales, drink her down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s to Betty Wales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She money gets in pails!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink her down, drink her down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink her down, down, down!&rdquo;</span></div></div>

<p>Betty went to the window and leaned out
to wave her hand to the group of juniors who
were laughing up at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything but just suggest,&ldquo;
she insisted. &ldquo;It was 19&mdash; that carried it
through. Let&rsquo;s sing to 19&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they sang to 19&mdash; and to Harding College,
and then the crowd dispersed merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Betty, turning
away from the window. Then she
laughed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad they did. I hope
they&rsquo;ll do it again some day&mdash;when I&rsquo;m a
senior.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
